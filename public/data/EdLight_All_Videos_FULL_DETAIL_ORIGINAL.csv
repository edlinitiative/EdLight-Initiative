Chemistry,NSI,Unit 1: Introduction to Chemistry (Entwodiksyon a Chimi),Divizyon Chimi (Branches of Chemistry),"Learning Objectives: Identify and describe the main branches of chemistry (organic, inorganic, physical, analytical, biochemistry, etc.) and their areas of focus ; recognize examples of each branch in everyday contexts.
Key Concepts: Overview of chemistry’s subdivisions: Organic chemistry (Chimi Òganik – study of carbon compounds), Inorganic chemistry (Chimi Inòganik – substances not primarily carbon-based), Physical chemistry (Chimi Fizik – principles and energy in chemical systems), Analytical chemistry (Chimi Analitik – composition of substances, e.g. testing water purity), Biochemistry (Biyochimi – chemistry of living organisms). Emphasize that all branches are interrelated and important .
Activities/Experiments: Students match real-world professions or tasks to the branch of chemistry (e.g. famasi – pharmacy to biochemistry, metaliji – metallurgy to inorganic chemistry). Conduct a virtual lab tour: show short clips or images of a lab for each branch (e.g. an organic chemist synthesizing a drug vs. an analytical chemist doing water quality tests). Glossary exercise: Provide a list of Creole/French terms for each branch (e.g. Chimi òganik / Chimie organique) and have students pair them with descriptions.
Quiz/Assessment Ideas: Multiple-choice or matching quiz where students match descriptions or examples (like “studying the chemical composition of a soil sample”) to the correct branch of chemistry. Short response: “Ki brANCH chimi ki enplike nan etid dwòg medikal yo?” (“Which branch of chemistry is involved in the study of medicinal drugs?” Answer: organic or biochemistry)."
Chemistry,NSI,Unit 1: Introduction to Chemistry (Entwodiksyon a Chimi),Enpòtans Chimi nan Lavi Chak Jou (The Importance of Chemistry in Daily Life),"Learning Objectives: Recognize how chemistry is part of daily life in Haiti and globally; identify common products and processes around them that are results of chemistry (food cooking, cleaning, medicine, environment) .
Key Concepts: Chemistry’s role in everyday life: Food and cooking (e.g. kwit manje – cooking involves chemical reactions like caramelization), Health and medicine (medications, vaccines are chemical formulations), Cleaning products (soap – savon, bleach – klowòks – are chemicals that kill germs), Environment (water purification, fertilizer for crops), Materials (plastic, metal alloys, building materials involve chemistry). Emphasize in Creole that “Chimi se lavi” (chemistry is life) through these examples.
Activities/Experiments: Everyday chemistry scavenger hunt – students list or photograph 5 items at home that involve chemistry (e.g. vinig (vinegar) used in cooking/cleaning, batri (battery) generating electricity via chemical reaction). Simple at-home experiment: mix baking soda (* bicarbonat*) and vinegar (vinèg) to demonstrate a quick chemical reaction producing gas (relating to cooking – this is how baking powder works in dough). Students can also make “invisible ink” with lemon juice and heat (an example of chemical change).
Quiz/Assessment Ideas: Provide scenarios and ask which involves chemistry (e.g. iron rusting, water boiling, fruit ripening – all involve chemical processes). True/False questions: “Chimi pa gen anyen pou l’wè ak kwit manje” (“Chemistry has nothing to do with cooking”) – expected answer False, with explanation. Short answer: name one way chemistry helps improve health or daily life (in Creole or French terms)."
Chemistry,NSI,Unit 1: Introduction to Chemistry (Entwodiksyon a Chimi),Entwodiksyon a Chimi – Definisyon ak Istwa (Introduction to Chemistry: Definition and History),"Learning Objectives: Understand what chemistry is and how it has evolved over time; recognize major milestones in the history of chemistry (from ancient alchemy to modern science) ; appreciate chemistry as a scientific discipline.
Key Concepts: Definition of chemistry as the study of matter and its transformations; brief history of chemistry (early alchemists, discovery of elements, Lavoisier’s role in establishing modern chemistry) ; understanding that chemistry is everywhere (“Chimi nan tout bagay” – chemistry in everything).
Activities/Experiments: Documentary research – Students create a simple timeline of key events or scientists in chemistry’s history (e.g. dekouvèt oksijèn pa Lavoisier – discovery of oxygen by Lavoisier) . They can watch a short video (in Creole or French) about the history of chemistry and discuss in groups. Optionally, have students identify an old practice (like making soap or fermenting foods) and link it to chemical principles.
Quiz/Assessment Ideas: List one important chemist and their contribution; multiple-choice questions on what chemistry studies and why ancient alchemists are considered early chemists; short answer: “Why is Lavoisier called the father of modern chemistry?” (answered in Creole, e.g. Paske li te montre enpòtans konsèvasyon mas nan reyaksyon chimik – Because he demonstrated the importance of mass conservation in chemical reactions)."
Chemistry,NSI,Unit 2: Matter and Energy (Matiè ak Enèji),Diferan Fòm Enèji (Different Forms of Energy),"Learning Objectives: Define energy in scientific terms; list and describe various forms of energy (mechanical, thermal, chemical, electrical, light, etc.) and give examples of each ; understand that energy can change form but is conserved.
Key Concepts: Energy (enèji) is the ability to do work or cause change. Forms of energy include mechanical energy (enèji mekanik) – e.g. moving objects, thermal energy (heat, chalè) – e.g. fire, chemical energy (enèji chimik) – stored in fuel or food, electrical energy – electricity, radiant energy (light from the sun), etc. Introduce the concept of energy conversion (e.g. chemical energy in a battery converts to electrical energy). Emphasize each form’s characteristics (e.g. chalè produces warmth, enèji limyè – light energy helps plants grow).
Activities/Experiments: Energy observation walk – students look around their home or school to identify examples of each energy form (e.g. a radio uses electrical energy, cooking uses thermal and chemical energy). Simple demonstration: show a pendil (pendulum) or a ball tossed in the air to illustrate conversion between kinetic and potential energy (with teacher guidance in video). Have students rub their hands together quickly – they feel heat (thermal energy) produced from mechanical motion (kinetic energy).
Quiz/Assessment Ideas: Matching exercise: match an example to the type of energy (e.g. sunlight – radiant, a battery – chemical). Fill-in-the-blank: “Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only ________” (expected: transformed). Short answer: name two forms of energy involved when turning on a flashlight (chemical in batteries to electrical to light)."
Chemistry,NSI,Unit 2: Matter and Energy (Matiè ak Enèji),Eta Fizik Matyè ak Chanjman Eta (Physical States of Matter and Changes of State),"Learning Objectives: Name and describe the three principal states of matter – solid (sòlid), liquid (likid), gas (gaz) ; compare their properties (shape, volume, particle arrangement); explain common changes of state (melting, freezing, evaporation, condensation, sublimation) and what causes these changes .
Key Concepts: Solids (sòlid): have fixed shape and volume, particles tightly packed (e.g. ice, a rock). Liquids (likid): have fixed volume but take the shape of their container, particles are close but can flow (e.g. liquid water). Gases (gaz): have no fixed shape or volume, they expand to fill their container, particles far apart and moving fast (e.g. water vapor). Changes of state (chanjman eta): melting (fonn) – solid to liquid, freezing (jeledi) – liquid to solid, evaporation/boiling (evaporasyon/eboyaj) – liquid to gas, condensation (kondansasyon) – gas to liquid, sublimation (siblimasyon) – solid to gas (e.g. dry ice). These changes occur with heat energy absorbed or released (heating causes particles to move apart, cooling causes them to come together).
Activities/Experiments: Have students observe ice melting in their hands (solid to liquid) and water boiling (liquid to gas as steam). They can also observe condensation by putting a cold glass in humid air and seeing water droplets form on it (gas to liquid). For sublimation, if available, watch a video of dry ice turning directly into gas. In a virtual simulation or drawing, students arrange “particles” (draw circles) to depict solids, liquids, and gases.
Quiz/Assessment Ideas: Fill-in-the-blank: “When water boils, it turns into ______” (steam/gas). Ask why sweating cools you down (evaporation is a cooling process – takes heat away). Multiple-choice: which state of matter has a fixed volume but not a fixed shape? (Liquid). Short answer: Describe what happens to particle movement when water freezes into ice (they slow down and arrange in a rigid structure)."
Chemistry,NSI,Unit 2: Matter and Energy (Matiè ak Enèji),Matiè – Definisyon ak Estrikti (Matter – Definition and Structure),"Learning Objectives: Define matter (matyè) as anything that has mass and takes up space ; understand that matter is made up of tiny particles (atoms or molecules); distinguish between matter and forms of energy (e.g. a rock is matter, sunlight is energy).
Key Concepts: Matter has mass (mas) and volume (volim) . All matter is composed of particles – typically atoms or molecules – which are too small to see. Introduce the basic particle model: particles are constantly moving and spaced differently in different states. Everything tangible (air, water, solids) is matter, whereas forms of energy (light, heat) are not matter. Mention that particles of matter (patikil matyè) are held together by forces and can form substances.
Activities/Experiments: Demonstration of matter taking space: fill a syringe with air and press the plunger to feel resistance (air is matter occupying space). Or submerge an upside-down cup in water to show air trapped (proof that air occupies volume). For particle concept, you can have students dissolve a spoon of salt in water – it “disappears” but the water tastes salty, indicating salt’s particles are still present in the water (matter is made of particles too small to see).
Quiz/Assessment Ideas: Multiple choice: identify which of the following is matter vs not matter (options: stone, sunlight, air, sound). True/False: “Air does not have mass” (False – students should recall air has mass and volume). Short response: give one evidence that matter is made of particles (e.g. dissolving or diffusion examples)."
Chemistry,NSI,Unit 3: Pure Substances and Mixtures (Sibstans Pi ak Melanj),Metòd Separasyon Fizik Melanj (Physical Methods of Separating Mixtures),"Learning Objectives: Identify and describe common physical separation techniques for mixtures ; understand that these methods exploit differences in physical properties (particle size, boiling point, density, solubility, magnetism, etc.) to separate components without changing their chemical identities.
Key Concepts: Main separation methods: Filtration (Filtrasyon) – separates solids from liquids using a filter (e.g. filtering sand out of water) ; Distillation (Distilasyon) – separates substances by boiling and condensing (exploits different boiling points, e.g. obtaining pure water from saltwater) ; Evaporation – letting the liquid part vaporize to leave solids behind (e.g. getting salt crystals by evaporating seawater); Decantation (Dekantasyon) – pouring off a liquid from a settled solid or separating two immiscible liquids (like oil and water); Chromatography (optional introduction) – separating mixtures based on movement through a medium (e.g. separating ink pigments on paper); Magnetic separation – using a magnet to pull out magnetic material (e.g. iron filings from sand). Emphasize that no new substances are formed during these separations (they are physical changes).
Activities/Experiments: Hands-on Separation: Provide or have students design simple separation tasks: e.g. filter muddy water (dlo labou) through coffee filter or cloth to obtain clearer water ; perform a simple distillation demonstration in video (heat saltwater in a pot with a lid to collect condensed droplets, or a solar still with a bowl and plastic wrap) to show how distilled water (dlo distile) can be obtained . Home experiment: evaporate saltwater in a shallow dish under the sun and observe salt crystals after water evaporates. Another easy activity: use a spoon to skim oil off the top of water (decanting immiscible liquids), or use a magnet to separate iron filings (or a magnet-attracted item like steel staples) from sand if available. For fun, do paper chromatography with a strip of paper and marker ink to show color separation.
Quiz/Assessment Ideas: Matching exercise: match a mixture to the best separation method (e.g. “sand and water” → filtration, “salt dissolved in water” → evaporation or distillation, “iron nails and sawdust” → use magnet for nails). Scenario questions: “How would you obtain drinking water from muddy river water?” (Expected answer: let solids settle then filter, possibly boil). True/False: “Distillation can separate components of a liquid mixture by their boiling points” (True). Fill-in: “To separate a solid that does not dissolve in a liquid, one effective method is __” (filtration)."
Chemistry,NSI,Unit 3: Pure Substances and Mixtures (Sibstans Pi ak Melanj),Sibstans Pi kont Melanj (Pure Substances vs. Mixtures),"Learning Objectives: Define and distinguish a pure substance (sibstans pi) from a mixture (melanj) ; understand that pure substances have consistent properties and composition, while mixtures contain two or more components combined physically; classify examples of substances as pure elements, pure compounds, or mixtures.
Key Concepts: Pure substance: matter with a uniform and unchanging composition – can be an element (e.g. òksijèn – oxygen gas O₂) or a compound (e.g. dlo – water H₂O). Pure substances have fixed characteristic properties like specific boiling/freezing points. Mixture: a combination of two or more substances that are not chemically bonded (e.g. seawater, air, a salad). Mixtures can be homogeneous (omojèn, uniform composition, e.g. salt dissolved in water) or heterogeneous (etèrojèn, non-uniform, e.g. sandy water). Physical properties of mixtures (boiling point, density, etc.) can vary depending on composition . Example: distilled water boils at 100°C at standard conditions (pure substance) while seawater (a mixture) may boil at a slightly higher temperature and has a range.
Activities/Experiments: Students list items at home and identify them as pure substance or mixture (e.g. sugar or sik – pure compound; kitchen salt – pure compound if 100% NaCl; saltwater or dlo sèl – mixture; juice – mixture). Comparative experiment: Measure or observe differences: for instance, take ice cubes made from pure water and salty water – note if they melt at different rates or temperatures (illustrating how salt (a solute) changes freezing point). Or simpler, demonstrate that an egg floats in saltwater but sinks in pure water, indicating a density change due to mixture. Students can also use a thermometer (if available) to record the boiling temperature of tap water versus salty water (carefully) and compare results .
Quiz/Assessment Ideas: Provide a list of materials (iron nail, bronze alloy, baking soda, milk, oxygen) and ask which are pure substances and which are mixtures. Multiple choice: “Which property is the same for every sample of a pure substance under the same conditions?” A) Boiling point , B) Color, C) Volume – correct answer: A) Boiling point (color could differ for different forms like allotropes, volume is just amount). True/False: “Air is a pure substance” (False – air is a homogeneous mixture of gases)."
Chemistry,NSI,Unit 4: Properties of Matter (Pwopriyete Matyè),Entwodiksyon a Radyoaktivite (Introduction to Radioactivity),"Learning Objectives: Understand what radioactivity (radyoaktivite) is at a basic level (unstable atomic nuclei releasing energy/particles); differentiate the main types of nuclear radiation (alpha, beta, gamma) in simple terms; discuss the advantages and disadvantages of radioactivity in real life   – including its applications and its hazards.
Key Concepts: Radioactivity is a property of certain materials (like uranium, radium) where their atoms break down spontaneously, emitting radiation. Radiation can be in forms of particles (alpha α, beta β) or high-energy waves (gamma γ). Pros: Radioactivity has beneficial uses – e.g. medical imaging and treatments (X-rays, cancer radiotherapy), sterilization of medical equipment, generating electricity in nuclear power plants, carbon dating in archaeology. Cons: Radioactive emissions can damage living tissue – can cause radiation sickness, increase cancer risk; radioactive waste is hazardous and must be contained; nuclear accidents (e.g. Chernobyl, Fukushima) have long-lasting environmental impact. Also mention the natural source of radiation (the sun’s cosmic rays, radon gas) and that at low levels radiation is managed but high doses are dangerous. Key terms in Creole/French: iradyasyon (irradiation), talfòm (half-life, if needed). Emphasize safety: handling radioactive materials requires special precautions.
Activities/Experiments: Since direct experimentation is not feasible, focus on research and virtual demonstrations: Students do a mini-research project (in Creole or French) on one application of radioactivity (e.g. how X-ray imaging works – Radyo X, or how food is preserved by irradiation) . Watch a short documentary clip (with Creole voiceover or subtitles) about Marie Curie’s discovery of radioactive elements or a video demonstrating a Geiger counter clicking near a radioactive source. If possible, simulate radioactive decay with a fun activity: use popcorn kernels popping (randomness of decay) or shake a box of different colored beads where a certain color represents “decayed” atoms after each shake to simulate half-life.
Quiz/Assessment Ideas: True/False: “Radioactivity can be beneficial to human health” (True, in controlled uses like cancer treatment). Multiple-choice: “Which of these is NOT a risk associated with radioactivity? A) Radiation burns, B) Nuclear waste, C) Formation of new elements, D) Cancer risk” – correct answer: C) Formation of new elements (though technically new elements/isotopes can form from decay, the “risk” phrasing makes C the odd one out). Short answer: Name one useful application of radioactivity and one harmful effect. For example, “Yon avantaj se itilize radyografi nan lopital, e yon inconvénient se polisyon radyoaktif ki ka koze maladi.” (“One advantage is using X-rays in hospitals, and one disadvantage is radioactive pollution that can cause illness.”)"
Chemistry,NSI,Unit 4: Properties of Matter (Pwopriyete Matyè),Pwopriyete Chimik Matyè (Chemical Properties of Matter),"Learning Objectives: Define chemical properties and provide examples; distinguish chemical changes from physical changes by the formation of new substances; recognize common signs of a chemical change (gas production, color change, heat/light, precipitate formation) .
Key Concepts: Chemical properties (pwopriyete chimik) describe a substance’s ability to undergo specific chemical changes, i.e. how it reacts with other substances. Examples: flammability (inflamabilite – ability to burn in air, like charcoal burning), reactivity with acids or bases (e.g. zinc reacts with acid to produce hydrogen gas), ability to rust or oxidize (iron reacts with oxygen to form rust), tendency to decompose (like hydrogen peroxide breaking down). A chemical change (chanjman chimik) or chemical reaction (reyaksyon chimik) results in new substances with new identities (e.g. burning paper produces ash and gases, iron rusting produces iron oxide). Indicators of chemical change include: gas bubbling (effervescence), formation of a solid in solution (precipitate), energy release or absorption (temperature change, light), and permanent color change. Contrast with physical change: chemical changes are usually not easily reversible and involve bonds breaking/forming.
Activities/Experiments: Safe small-scale chemical changes: mix vinegar (vinèg, a weak acid) with baking soda (bikabònat, a base) to produce carbon dioxide gas (bubbling) – an obvious chemical reaction with new products (CO₂, water, sodium acetate). Combustion demo: If possible under supervision, burn a small piece of paper or wood – observe flame (heat/light), smoke (gas), char (new solid) – evidence of chemical change (cannot easily turn ash back to paper). Rusting experiment: Dip steel wool in vinegar (to remove its protective coating) and leave it exposed to air; over time it rusts (color change to orange, exothermic warmth can be felt early on) – students observe over days how a new substance (rust) forms. Alternatively, use an online video of iron rusting if time is short. Students can also observe how fruit browning (like an apple slice left out) is a slow chemical change (oxidation).
Quiz/Assessment Ideas: Ask students to identify which scenarios are chemical changes: e.g. ice melting vs. wood burning, milk souring vs. sugar dissolving. True/False: “When a chemical change occurs, the total mass of substances changes” (False – law of mass conservation still holds, mass is the same, just rearranged). Multiple-choice: “Which of these is a chemical property? A) density, B) melts at 0°C, C) reacts with acid to produce gas” – correct: C. Short answer: Provide one observable sign of a chemical reaction and give an example (e.g. gas production – effervescence when Alka-Seltzer is dropped in water)."
Chemistry,NSI,Unit 4: Properties of Matter (Pwopriyete Matyè),Pwopriyete Fizik Matyè (Physical Properties of Matter),"Learning Objectives: Define physical properties and identify examples; distinguish between physical properties and physical changes; understand how physical properties (e.g. melting point, density) can be measured or observed without altering the substance’s chemical identity .
Key Concepts: Physical properties (pwopriyete fizik) are characteristics that can be observed or measured without changing what the substance is. Examples: color, odor, hardness, density (dansite), melting point (pwen fonn), boiling point (pwen ebulisyon), state of matter (solid/liquid/gas at room temperature), conductivity (ability to conduct heat or electricity), malleability (bendability of metals), etc. Physical change (chanjman fizik): a change in form or appearance that does not produce a new substance (e.g. tearing paper, melting ice, dissolving sugar in water). Emphasize that in a physical change, the molecules remain the same (water is H₂O as ice or liquid or vapor – just arranged differently). We can often reverse physical changes (refreeze water, recover dissolved salt by evaporation).
Activities/Experiments: Students measure or observe physical properties: e.g. find the density of an object (measure its mass and volume – perhaps use a rock: weigh it and measure volume by water displacement). Measure temperature at which ice melts (0°C) or water boils (100°C) with a thermometer if available, noting those are unique to water (a pure substance). Simple observation: have various objects/liquids and identify their physical properties (color of sulfur powder, odor of vinegar, transparency of glass, etc.). Another idea: Condensation experiment – have students capture water condensation by holding a cold metal spoon over boiling water to illustrate a physical change (steam to liquid water).
Quiz/Assessment Ideas: List some properties and ask if they are physical or not (e.g. “flammability” – not physical, “density” – physical). Multiple-choice: “Which is a physical property? A) burns in air, B) is red in color, C) reacts with acid – correct: B) red color.” True/False: “Dissolving sugar in water is a physical change” (True, because sugar can be recovered by evaporation). Short explanation: Why is melting gold a physical change? (It’s still gold, just liquid form)."
Chemistry,NSI,Unit 5: Measurement in Chemistry (Mezi an Chimi),Inite Mezi ak Konvèsyon (Units of Measurement and Unit Conversion),"Learning Objectives: Introduce the SI units (Système International) commonly used in chemistry for length, mass, volume, temperature, and amount; teach how to convert between units (e.g. grams to kilograms, milliliters to liters, Celsius to Kelvin if appropriate) ; reinforce understanding of prefixes (milli-, centi-, kilo-) and how they scale units by factors of 10.
Key Concepts: Standard units: Mass in kilograms (kg) or grams (g), Volume in liters (L) or cubic centimeters (cm³), Length in meters (m) (for chemistry, maybe to measure distances in experiments or sizes of objects), Temperature in degrees Celsius (°C) and the concept of Kelvin (K) as the SI base unit for temperature (though at this level, focus on °C for practical use; mention 0°C = 273 K), Time in seconds (s). Explain common metric prefixes: kilo- (k, 1000×), centi- (c, 1/100), milli- (m, 1/1000), etc. Show how to convert units by moving the decimal or using conversion factors: e.g. 1 L = 1000 mL, so to convert 250 mL to L, divide by 1000 (result 0.250 L). Emphasize using units consistently in calculations (dimensional analysis basics). If applicable, introduce the concept of unit “mole” here as the unit for amount of substance (though it will be covered fully in Unit 6, a quick mention that “mol” is the counting unit in chemistry).
Activities/Experiments: Conversion practice: Students practice by converting real examples: e.g. take a 500 mL bottle of water – how many liters is that? If a person has 60 kg mass, what is that in grams? Provide measuring tapes, kitchen scales, or graduated containers if available and have students measure something in one unit and convert to another (measure a table in cm then convert to m, or volume of a cup in mL to L). Create a “unit conversion relay”: one student writes a measurement in one unit, next student converts it to another unit, and so on. Use everyday product labels (like a soda bottle labeled 1.5 L or medicine of 5 mL dose) to discuss units.
Quiz/Assessment Ideas: Simple conversion questions: “Convert 2000 mg to grams” (2 g), “How many milliliters in 0.5 L?” (500 mL). Matching: match units to what they measure (meter – length, Kelvin – temperature, etc.). True/False: “1 cubic centimeter is the same volume as 1 milliliter” (True, 1 cm³ = 1 mL). Fill-in: “The prefix kilo- means multiply by ______” (1000). Word problem: If a chemistry experiment calls for 0.2 kg of salt, how many grams is that? (Answer: 200 g)."
Chemistry,NSI,Unit 5: Measurement in Chemistry (Mezi an Chimi),Zouti Mezi ak Teknik (Measuring Instruments and Techniques),"Learning Objectives: Familiarize students with common laboratory and household instruments for measurement  ; demonstrate proper techniques to measure mass, volume, and temperature accurately; stress the importance of precision (pwopòsyon ekzak) and reading instruments correctly (e.g. at eye level for volume).
Key Concepts: Balance (Balans) – instrument to measure mass (digital scale or beam balance). Show how to use it: zeroing/taring the scale before measuring, units in grams. Graduated cylinder (Silenn gradye) – to measure liquid volume; explain reading the bottom of the meniscus at eye level for accuracy. Mention other volume tools: pipette (pipèt) and burette (biret) for precise volume in labs , and a measuring cup at home. Thermometer (tèmomèt) – to measure temperature; reading in °C, ensure it’s in the substance long enough to stabilize . Ruler/Meterstick (Règ/mèt) – to measure length. Possibly mention a stopwatch or clock for time. Emphasize units on each instrument scale and the need to record units with measurements. Also cover measurement best practices: avoid parallax error (eye directly in line for reading), use appropriate scale (don’t use a huge beaker to measure 5 mL, etc.), and safety (don’t touch hot thermometers with bare hands, etc.).
Activities/Experiments: Mass measurement: Have students use a kitchen scale to measure different objects (e.g. a cup of sugar, a coin) and compare masses in grams. Volume measurement: If available, measure 50 mL of water in a graduated cylinder vs. in a kitchen measuring cup and compare accuracy. Show how to use a syringe as a makeshift pipette to measure small volumes (e.g. measure 5 mL of water using a syringe from medicine). Temperature: Measure the temperature of hot tap water vs. ice water with a thermometer (or a digital thermometer if available, like those used for cooking). Students practice reading values and writing them with units. They can also measure room dimensions with a tape measure and express in meters and centimeters.
Quiz/Assessment Ideas: Identify instrument from description or image: “Which instrument is best to measure 10 mL of liquid accurately?” (Graduated cylinder or pipette). Multiple choice: “What unit will a laboratory balance likely display?” A) °C, B) grams, C) liters – correct: B) grams. True/False: “When reading a graduated cylinder, you should read from the top of the meniscus.” (False – read from the bottom). Practical question: Given a diagram of a water meniscus in a cylinder with scale markings, ask what volume it reads (tests ability to interpret instrument). Short answer: Explain why it’s important to “tare” (zero) an electronic balance before measuring a chemical (so that the container’s mass is not included in the measurement)."
Chemistry,NSI,Unit 6: Mole Concept and Chemical Formulas (Konsep Mol ak Fòmil Chimik),Dètèminasyon Fòmil Chimik (Soti nan Konpozisyon) (Determining a Chemical Formula from Composition),"Learning Objectives: Show how to determine a compound’s empirical formula from experimental composition data (percentage or mass of each element in a sample) ; illustrate the step-by-step method: convert percentage to mass (assuming 100 g sample), convert mass to moles, divide by smallest mole count to get ratio, adjust to whole numbers. Also, explain how knowing the molar mass allows finding the molecular formula from the empirical formula.
Key Concepts: Percent composition (konpozisyon pousantaj) of a compound is the percent by mass of each element. To find empirical formula from percent composition: 1) Assume 100 g of the substance (so % becomes grams), 2) Convert grams of each element to moles (using atomic masses), 3) Divide each by the smallest number of moles to get a simple ratio, 4) If needed, multiply ratios by a common factor to get whole numbers. The resulting whole-number ratio gives the empirical formula . Molecular formula determination: once the empirical formula is known, calculate its formula mass; divide the compound’s known molar mass by the empirical formula mass to find the multiplier; multiply the empirical formula by this number to get molecular formula .
Activities/Experiments: Work through an example as a group (virtual lab/data analysis): e.g. a compound is found to contain 40.0% sulfur (S) and 60.0% oxygen (O) by mass. Determine its empirical formula. (Solution: Assume 100 g → 40.0 g S, 60.0 g O; moles S = 40.0/32.06 ≈ 1.248, moles O = 60.0/16.00 = 3.75; divide by 1.248: S ≈1, O ≈3; empirical formula = S O₃). Then discuss if the molecular molar mass was, say, 160 g/mol, what’s the molecular formula? (Empirical SO₃ ~ 80 g/mol, 160/80 = 2, so molecular = S₂O₆ which might simplify to 2SO₃ units—this is hypothetical as S₂O₆ could be written as S O₃ still as it’s ionic or polymeric; maybe a better example is needed, but concept stands). Another example: a hydrocarbon is 85.7% carbon and 14.3% hydrogen by mass – find empirical (C:H ~ 7.14:14.2 in moles → ~1:2, so CH₂). If molar mass ~28, molecular formula C₂H₄. Hands-on analogy: Use colored beads to represent moles of each element – e.g. 1 bead = 0.1 mole – given counts of beads for elements, simplify ratios physically.
Quiz/Assessment Ideas: Give a simple set of data: e.g. “A compound is 50% sulfur and 50% oxygen by mass. What is its empirical formula?” (S O, because 50 g S =1.56 mol, 50 g O =3.13 mol, ratio ~1:2, so S O₂ actually – correct that: 50/32 =1.56, 50/16 =3.125, ratio ~1:2, so formula S₁O₂). Provide an empirical formula and ask: if the molar mass is X, what is the molecular formula? (For instance: empirical CH₂O, molar mass 180 g/mol → molecular C₆H₁₂O₆). True/False: “To determine an empirical formula, you need to know the exact masses of each element in the sample.” (False – percentages or relative masses suffice as long as ratios are known; one can assume a basis like 100 g). Multi-step multiple choice: Might present a worked process with a blank for a step (like “divide each mole value by the smallest mole value to get ____”) to test understanding of the method."
Chemistry,NSI,Unit 6: Mole Concept and Chemical Formulas (Konsep Mol ak Fòmil Chimik),Fòmil Empirik kont Fòmil Molekilè (Empirical Formula vs Molecular Formula),"Learning Objectives: Explain what a chemical formula represents (the types and counts of atoms in a substance); differentiate between an empirical formula (simplest whole-number ratio of atoms in a compound) and a molecular formula (actual number of atoms in a single molecule of that compound)  ; give examples and practice determining one from the other.
Key Concepts: Chemical formula (fòmil chimik): notation using element symbols and numerical subscripts to indicate composition (e.g. H₂O means 2 H atoms and 1 O atom per molecule of water) . Empirical formula (fòmil empirik): the simplest ratio of elements in a compound. For example, the empirical formula of glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) is C H₂ O (CH₂O) because the elements are in a 1:2:1 ratio. Molecular formula (fòmil molekilè): the actual formula of a molecular compound, which is a whole-number multiple of the empirical formula. e.g. Glucose’s molecular formula is C₆H₁₂O₆ (which is 6 times CH₂O). Some substances have the same empirical and molecular formula (if the ratio cannot be simplified further, e.g. H₂O or CO₂). Emphasize that ionic compounds (like NaCl or CaCO₃) are usually represented by empirical formulas because they form crystal lattices, not discrete molecules. Also clarify: empirical formula comes from experimental data (like percent composition) while molecular formula gives the true composition of one molecule.
Activities/Experiments: Give students molecular formulas of some compounds and ask them to derive the empirical formula by simplifying ratios: e.g. C₂H₆ → CH₃; N₂O₄ → NO₂; H₂O₂ → HO. Conversely, present an empirical formula and a molar mass to determine the molecular formula: e.g. empirical CH₂ (molar mass ~14 g/mol), if actual molar mass is ~28 g/mol, molecular formula is C₂H₄. Use ball-and-stick model kits or drawn diagrams: students build molecules like ethane (C₂H₆) and see the ratio 2:6 simplifies to 1:3 for empirical (CH₃). They could also analyze a common compound: e.g. acetic acid (vinegar) has molecular formula C₂H₄O₂, which simplifies to CH₂O as empirical; discuss how different compounds can share an empirical formula (CH₂O is also empirical formula for glucose).
Quiz/Assessment Ideas: Provide a formula and ask if it can be an empirical formula, molecular formula, or both. Example: “Which of these could be an empirical formula? A) C₂H₆, B) C₃H₈, C) CH₄” – answer: C₃H₈ (propane) and CH₄ are empirical (C₂H₆ can be simplified to CH₃). Short calculation: “A compound has empirical formula NO₂. Its molar mass is about 92 g/mol. What is its molecular formula?” (Find formula mass of NO₂ ≈ 46 g; 92/46 = 2, so molecular formula N₂O₄). True/False: “The empirical formula of a compound is always different from its molecular formula.” (False – could be the same if the formula is already simplest). Fill-in: “The empirical formula represents the simplest ______ of atoms in a compound” (ratio)."
Chemistry,NSI,Unit 6: Mole Concept and Chemical Formulas (Konsep Mol ak Fòmil Chimik),Konpozisyon Massik (Mass Percent Composition Calculations),"Learning Objectives: Calculate the percentage by mass of each element in a compound given its formula ; reinforce the concept of mass composition as a way to describe a compound’s makeup; use percent composition to identify how much of a compound is a particular element (which is useful in lab settings for yields, nutrition chemistry, etc.).
Key Concepts: Mass percent of an element = (mass of element in 1 mole of compound ÷ molar mass of compound) × 100%. Illustrate with examples: e.g. in water (H₂O), %H = (2×1.01 g ÷ 18.02 g) ×100% ≈ 11.2%, %O ≈ 88.8%. The sum of all element percents = 100%. Emphasize that percent composition can be used to verify empirical formulas or to compare compounds (e.g. which has a higher percentage of calcium: CaCO₃ vs CaO). Also, if you know the percent composition, you can work backwards to find the formula (as done in the previous video), so this is the forward direction of that concept. Possibly touch on applications: e.g. calculating percent of iron in iron ore (important in mining), or percent of nitrogen in fertilizer (to evaluate its strength).
Activities/Experiments: Students calculate percent compositions for a few compounds: e.g. CO₂ (find %C and %O), NaCl (%Na and %Cl), C₂H₆O (etanòl) – this can be done with periodic table values provided. They can also use their results to answer questions like “If I have 10 g of NaCl, how many grams of sodium do I have?” (Using the percentage as a conversion). As a relatable context, consider something like “percent of oxygen in the air is ~21%” – though that’s a mixture example, or percent of water in a hydrate (maybe advanced for now). For a fun cross-curricular example, calculate the percent of sugar in a cup of tea if known (but that’s solution composition, not compound). Focus on formula-based calculations for now.
Quiz/Assessment Ideas: Calculate: “What percentage of ammonia (NH₃) is hydrogen by mass?” (H total = 3×1 =3; N=14; total 17; 3/17 ≈17.6%). Multiple-choice: “Which compound has the greatest percentage of oxygen by mass? A) H₂O, B) CO₂, C) Fe₂O₃” – students would calculate each or estimate (H₂O ~89%, CO₂ ~72.7%, Fe₂O₃ ~30% O; answer: H₂O). True/False: “In C₂H₅Cl, carbon contributes a larger percent of mass than chlorine” (False – chlorine is heavy ~35.45 vs carbons ~24 total). Fill in the blank: “The sum of all percentage compositions of elements in a compound equals ____” (100%)."
Chemistry,NSI,Unit 6: Mole Concept and Chemical Formulas (Konsep Mol ak Fòmil Chimik),Konsep Mol ak Mas Molè (The Mole Concept and Molar Mass),"Learning Objectives: Understand the mole (mol) as the standard unit for amount of substance in chemistry ; know that one mole corresponds to a fixed number of particles ($6.02\times10^{23}$, Avogadro’s number, though emphasis can be qualitative); relate the mole to atomic/molecular mass (molar mass) – e.g. the atomic mass of an element in atomic mass units (amu) is numerically equal to the mass of one mole of its atoms in grams .
Key Concepts: The mole (mol) – a “chemist’s dozen,” equals $6.022\times10^{23}$ entities (Avogadro’s number) but students can think of it as a very large number of particles . It allows counting atoms/molecules by weighing them. Molar mass (mas molè): the mass of one mole of a substance (in grams per mole, g/mol). For an element, the molar mass is the atomic weight from the periodic table (e.g. Carbon ~12.01 g/mol). For a compound, it’s the sum of the atomic masses in its formula (e.g. for H₂O: (2×1.01) + 16.00 ≈ 18.02 g/mol). Emphasize that molar mass bridges grams and number of particles: e.g. 18.02 g of water is 1 mole, which contains $6.02\times10^{23}$ molecules. Also explain basic use: if you have the mass of a sample, you can determine how many moles of substance it is by dividing by molar mass, and vice versa. This concept is foundational for chemical calculations (stoichiometry).
Activities/Experiments: Use analogies: “One mole of marbles would cover the Earth!” to convey how large Avogadro’s number is. If possible, measure roughly one mole of a substance: e.g. weigh 12.0 g of carbon (graphite from pencil lead) to represent 1 mole of C atoms (though pure carbon massing might be tricky – alternatively weigh 18 g of water to represent ~1 mole of water molecules, or 58.5 g of salt for 1 mole NaCl). Visualize particle count: show a small pile of salt or sugar ~1 mole and remind that it contains ~10^23 formula units – unimaginable count. Calculation practice: simple exercises like: “Calculate the molar mass of CO₂” or “How many moles in 10 g of water?” (with teacher guidance). Possibly use interactive tools or charts where students convert between moles, mass, and number of particles for a sample.
Quiz/Assessment Ideas: Multiple choice: “Avogadro’s number ($6.02\times10^{23}$) is the number of… A) particles in 1 mole, B) grams in a mole of carbon, C) atoms in 1 gram of hydrogen” – correct: A. Calculation: “The atomic mass of helium is 4.00 u. What is the mass of 1 mole of helium atoms?” (4.00 g). True/False: “1 mole of iron atoms contains the same number of atoms as 1 mole of carbon atoms” (True – a mole is always the same number of entities). Short answer: Why do chemists use the mole instead of counting individual atoms? (Atoms are extremely small and numerous; the mole provides a manageable way to measure them by mass)."
Chemistry,NSI,Unit 6: Mole Concept and Chemical Formulas (Konsep Mol ak Fòmil Chimik),Nonmenklati Debaz Konpoze Chimik (Basic Chemical Nomenclature of Compounds),"Learning Objectives: Introduce the rules for naming simple inorganic chemical compounds (according to official nomenclature)  ; enable students to name a compound from its formula and write the formula from its name for common cases: ionic compounds, molecular (covalent) compounds, and simple acids/bases if applicable. Emphasize consistency with French/Creole naming where relevant (since IUPAC names in French may use similar principles with some language differences).
Key Concepts: Ionic compounds (konpoze ionik): usually metal + non-metal. Naming: name of metal (in Creole/French or its element name) + name of non-metal with an “-ide” ending (in French “-ure” for some, but in Creole we might lean on the English/Latin-based name). E.g. NaCl: sodium chloride (klorid sodyòm or in French chlorure de sodium). For metals that have variable charges (like iron), use Roman numerals to indicate the charge: FeCl₂ = iron(II) chloride (klorid fè (II)). In French they might say chlorure de fer(II). We can present the Stock system since it’s international. Covalent (molecular) compounds (konpoze kowvalan ant de nonmetal): use prefixes for the number of atoms: mono-, di-, tri-, tétra-, etc (similar in French). E.g. CO₂ = carbon dioxide (gaz karbonik in everyday Creole, but scientifically “dyoksid kabòn”); CO = carbon monoxide (monoksid kabòn). Acids (asid) and bases (baz): perhaps only briefly, e.g. HCl is hydrochloric acid (asid kloridrik), NaOH is sodium hydroxide (idroksid sodyòm). Nomenclature practice: emphasize learning common ions (e.g. sulfate = SO₄²⁻, nitrate = NO₃⁻) for more complex salts if appropriate, but at Sec I, focus on binary compounds and a few common polyatomics. Also mention that some compounds have trivial or common names that students might know (H₂O = water /dlo; NH₃ = ammonia /amonyak; CH₃COOH = acetic acid in vinegar /asid asetik/vinèg). This video covers just an introduction and the most needed rules since full nomenclature is a broad topic.
Activities/Experiments: Naming practice: Provide a list of formulas for students to name (e.g. KBr, H₂SO₄, CO, N₂O₅, CaCl₂) and a list of names for which they write formulas (e.g. magnesium oxide – MgO, diphosphorus pentoxide – P₂O₅). They can work in pairs to check each other. Nomenclature cards: make index cards of cations and anions, have students combine them and name the result (like one card says “Na⁺”, another says “Cl⁻” – together NaCl, name: sodium chloride). Possibly incorporate French terms for reinforcement: e.g. “chlorure” corresponds to “chloride”. If resources permit, use an interactive online naming game or quiz. Connect to real world: show packaging or labels of common chemicals (baking soda labeled sodium bicarbonate, table salt sodium chloride, etc.) and decode the names with students.
Quiz/Assessment Ideas: Matching: match chemical formulas to names (or vice versa) for a set of compounds. True/False: “CO₂ is called carbon monoxide” (False – it’s dioxide). Multiple-choice: “What is the correct name for FeO? A) iron(II) oxide, B) iron(III) oxide, C) iron monoxide” – correct: iron(II) oxide (because Fe²⁺ with O²⁻). Fill-in: “The compound CuSO₄ is called copper(II) sulfate. In this name, the (II) indicates ____” (the charge +2 of the copper ion). Also possibly ask: “Write the formula for calcium nitrate” (Ca(NO₃)₂) or “What is the chemical formula for asid kloridrik (hydrochloric acid)?” (HCl). These gauge understanding of naming rules."
Chemistry,NSI,Unit 6: Mole Concept and Chemical Formulas (Konsep Mol ak Fòmil Chimik),Senbòl Chimik ak Eleman (Chemical Symbols and Elements),"Learning Objectives: Recognize that each chemical element (eleman chimik) is represented by a unique symbol (usually one or two letters) ; memorize symbols of common elements; distinguish between element names in Creole/French and their symbols (e.g. sodium = sodyòm (Fr. sodium) with symbol Na). Understand that an element is a pure substance made of one kind of atom.
Key Concepts: Chemical symbols (senbòl chimik): One or two-letter abbreviations for elements (e.g. H for hydrogen/idwojèn, O for oxygen/oksijèn, Fe for iron/fè from Latin ferrum). Explain the notation: first letter capitalized, second letter lowercase (if present). Many symbols derive from Latin names: e.g. Na (sodium from natrium), Au (gold from aurum). The Periodic Table (Tablo Peryodik) is introduced as the chart organizing all elements by their atomic number and symbol. Elements in Creole/French vs symbol examples: Iron = fè (Fr. fer) symbol Fe, Carbon = kabòn symbol C, Nitrogen = azòt symbol N. Emphasize that these symbols are universal in chemistry, allowing scientists speaking different languages to communicate. Also highlight that each element has an atomic number (nonm atomik) which equals the number of protons in its atoms – this defines the element.
Activities/Experiments: Element Symbol Bingo: Create bingo cards with element symbols and call out element names (in Creole or French) for students to mark the corresponding symbol. Flashcards game: students pair element names with symbols. Have students find everyday items and identify the elements in them by symbol (e.g. aluminum foil – Al, copper wire – Cu, water has H and O, salt has Na and Cl). If a periodic table poster or handout is available, let students explore it: find an element with a given symbol or vice versa, or color-code certain common element symbols. A mini-research: pick one element (perhaps one found in Haiti or of personal interest) and report its symbol, where it’s found or used (e.g. Calcium Ca in limestone or bones, Iron Fe in rebar and blood).
Quiz/Assessment Ideas: Matching: match each symbol to the correct element name (H → Hydrogen, Ca → Calcium, K → Potassium, etc.). Fill-in: “The symbol for gold is ____” (Au). Multiple-choice: “Which of these is NOT a correct chemical symbol? A) Co for cobalt, B) CO for cobalt, C) Na for sodium” – correct answer: B (CO is two capital letters, which actually represents a compound carbon monoxide, not a single element symbol). True/False: “All countries use the same chemical symbols for elements” (True). Short answer: Provide the symbol for two elements present in water (Expected: H and O)."
Chemistry,NSI,Unit 7: Chemical Reactions (Reyaksyon Chimike),Ekwasyon Chimike ak Balanse (Chemical Equations and Balancing),"Learning Objectives: Learn to represent chemical reactions with equations using formulas and symbols ; interpret the parts of a chemical equation (reactants, products, arrow meaning “yields”); apply the law of conservation of mass to balance chemical equations so that the same number of each atom appears on both sides .
Key Concepts: Chemical equation (ekwasyon chimik): a shorthand notation of a reaction, e.g. 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O. Reactants are listed on the left, products on the right, an arrow indicates the direction. Coefficients in front of formulas indicate the number of molecules/moles reacting. Balancing an equation: adding coefficients to ensure each element’s atom count is equal on both sides (this reflects mass conservation). For example, unbalanced: H₂ + O₂ → H₂O (would have 2 H on left, 2 H on right; 2 O on left, 1 O on right – not balanced). Balanced: 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O (4 H and 2 O on both sides). Rules: can only change coefficients, not subscripts (subscripts are fixed by chemical identity). Strategy: balance one element at a time, often start with metals, then nonmetals, leave H and O or lone elements for last, adjust coefficients iteratively. Mention states if needed (s, l, g, aq) but not necessary at this level except to illustrate full notation; focus is on atom counts. Emphasize that coefficients represent mole ratios as well (2 H₂ means 2 moles of H₂ etc.).
Activities/Experiments: Equation balancing practice: Begin with simple equations on board or paper: students practice balancing progressively harder equations. For a tactile approach: use colored tokens or a visual kit to represent atoms – physically arrange them to represent reactants and products and adjust until balanced. For example, use two different colors of beads for H and O; show 2 blue (H₂) + 1 red (O₂) yields 2 water (each water = 2 blue + 1 red), physically verify numbers. Another activity: “balance the equation” game – break class into small groups, each group gets an unbalanced equation and they race to provide the correct coefficients. Use real reaction examples: combustion of methane CH₄ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O, or formation of rust 4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃, etc. If possible, after balancing on paper, demonstrate one reaction (like burning methane or a candle for combustion equation) to connect equation with real reaction.
Quiz/Assessment Ideas: Provide unbalanced equations and ask students to pick the correct balanced form from multiple choices. Example: “__ C + __ O₂ → __ CO₂”; choices might include “C + O₂ → CO₂” vs “2C + O₂ → 2CO₂” etc. Fill in the blank: “Balance: Na + Cl₂ → NaCl” (Answer: 2Na + Cl₂ → 2NaCl). True/False: “Coefficients in a balanced equation can be fractions” (Typically false in final form, we use whole numbers; although one might use fractions in intermediate steps, final answer uses whole numbers). A short prompt: “Explain why we balance chemical equations” (Expected: to satisfy the law of conservation of mass – same number of each atom on both sides)."
Chemistry,NSI,Unit 7: Chemical Reactions (Reyaksyon Chimike),Entwodiksyon a Estekiometri (Introduction to Stoichiometric Calculations),"Learning Objectives: Use a balanced chemical equation to interpret mole ratios of reactants and products  ; perform basic stoichiometric calculations: given a certain amount (in moles or grams) of one substance, calculate the amount (moles or grams) of another substance produced or consumed, using the mole ratio  . This video will introduce stoichiometry with simple cases (no limiting reagents in this introduction unless desired as extension).
Key Concepts: Stoichiometry (estekiometri): the quantitative relationship between reactants and products in a balanced chemical reaction. Mole ratio (rapò molè or rapò estekiometrik): derived from the coefficients of a balanced equation, it tells how many moles of one substance react with or produce how many moles of another . E.g. in the equation 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O, the mole ratio of H₂ to H₂O is 2:2 (simplifies to 1:1), H₂ to O₂ is 2:1, etc. Steps for calculations: 1) Convert known quantity to moles (if given in grams, use molar mass). 2) Use the mole ratio from the balanced equation to find moles of desired substance. 3) Convert moles of desired substance to grams if needed (using its molar mass). Example: How many grams of water can be produced from 4 moles of H₂? Use ratio 2 mol H₂ produces 2 mol H₂O, so 4 mol H₂ yields 4 mol H₂O; 4 mol H₂O * (18 g/mol) = 72 g H₂O. Introduce the concept of a limiting reactant only conceptually (if one reactant is used up first, it limits product), but detailed limiting reagent calculations might be left for more advanced study. However, one could mention: if quantities of more than one reactant are given, the smaller product yield prediction indicates the limiting reagent.
Activities/Experiments: Work through a concrete example: use the reaction of copper and silver nitrate as per curriculum suggestion  : Cu + 2AgNO₃ → Cu(NO₃)₂ + 2Ag. If 1 mole of Cu is reacted, how many moles of Ag will form? (Answer: 2 moles Ag). How many grams is that? (2 moles Ag * 107.9 g/mol = 215.8 g). If available, show a video or demonstration of this reaction: a copper wire in silver nitrate solution gets coated with silver metal. Tie it to calculations: measure the mass of copper consumed and silver deposited to confirm ratio (like in suggestion, they weighed copper before and after, collected silver, etc.)  . Another practice: the classic reaction 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O, ask: “If we have 5 g of H₂, how many grams of H₂O can form (assuming O₂ excess)?” (5 g H₂ is 2.5 mol; 2.5 mol H₂ yields 2.5 mol H₂O; 2.5 mol *18 g=45 g water). Provide simple exercises where one reactant is in excess so only one conversion needed. Optionally introduce an online stoichiometry simulation or interactive calculator for students to verify their results.
Quiz/Assessment Ideas: Calculation questions such as: “Given the balanced equation N₂ + 3H₂ → 2NH₃, how many moles of NH₃ can be produced from 3 moles of H₂?” (3 H₂ gives 2 NH₃, but need to see ratio: 3 mol H₂ * (2 mol NH₃ / 3 mol H₂) = 2 mol NH₃). Or “In the above reaction, how many grams of NH₃ (molar mass ~17 g/mol) is that?” (2 *17 = 34 g). Multiple choice: “The equation 4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃ implies: A) 4 g Fe reacts with 3 g O₂, B) 4 moles Fe react with 3 moles O₂, C) 4 atoms Fe react with 3 molecules O₂” – best answer: B (the coefficients represent moles; A is false because grams don’t directly match coefficients, C is small scale true but impractical context). True/False: “Stoichiometry allows us to predict the amounts of products from given reactants” (True). Short answer: If 10 g of reactant A produces 15 g of product B in a reaction, how would you figure out how much product 20 g of reactant A would produce (assuming A is limiting)? (Expect: by doubling – 30 g B – or by doing proportional calculation or converting to moles and using ratio)."
Chemistry,NSI,Unit 7: Chemical Reactions (Reyaksyon Chimike),Kisa ki yon Reyaksyon Chimike? (What is a Chemical Reaction?),"Learning Objectives: Define a chemical reaction (reyaksyon chimik) as a process where substances (reactants) transform into new substances (products) ; understand the Law of Conservation of Mass (Lwa Konsèvasyon Mas) – matter is neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction ; understand that energy is also conserved (though may be released or absorbed as heat, light, etc.) in a reaction. Recognize that chemical reactions involve breaking and forming chemical bonds.
Key Concepts: In a chemical reaction, atoms are rearranged to form new combinations, but the total number of each type of atom remains the same (mass conserved) . State Lavoisier’s principle: “Rien ne se perd, rien ne se crée, tout se transforme” (nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed) – in Creole: “Anyen pa pèdi, anyen pa kreye, tout chanje fòm.” Conservation of mass means if you start with 10 g of reactants, you get 10 g of products (assuming a closed system). Conservation of energy: energy can change form (chemical energy -> heat/light), but total energy remains constant; however, in practice we often focus on whether a reaction releases energy (exothermic, e.g. combustion releasing heat) or absorbs energy (endothermic, e.g. photosynthesis requiring sunlight). Also discuss why reactions happen: bonds breaking (requires energy) and bonds forming (releases energy). Provide examples of chemical reactions: combustion (burning), acid-base neutralization, rusting, digestion of food, etc.
Activities/Experiments: Mass conservation demonstration: If possible, perform an experiment where a reaction occurs in a closed system: e.g. react vinegar and baking soda inside a zip-lock bag or a balloon sealed on a flask – show that when the reaction is contained, the total mass before and after stays the same (students can weigh the setup before and after, seeing mass is equal, whereas an open reaction would seem to lose mass as CO₂ escapes)  . Alternatively, have students simply observe that mixing two solutions (say salt solution and silver nitrate solution forming a precipitate) in a beaker doesn’t magically create or destroy matter – the combined mass of both solutions equals mass of mixture + precipitate (teacher can demonstrate on a scale if available). Energy observation: touch a flask during an exothermic reaction (like yeast and hydrogen peroxide generating heat) – feels warm (released energy) vs an endothermic reaction (e.g. baking soda and vinegar feels slightly cold). Students can also do a simple baking soda + vinegar in balloon experiment at home to qualitatively see gas is matter (inflates balloon but total mass unchanged).
Quiz/Assessment Ideas: Concept check: “According to the conservation of mass, if 5 grams of A react with 5 grams of B, the total mass of products will be ___ grams.” (10 grams). True/False: “In a chemical reaction, atoms of elements can disappear if the reaction releases gas.” (False – atoms in gas are just dispersed, not disappeared). Multiple-choice: “Which statement is true for every chemical reaction? A) It gives off heat, B) The total number of each type of atom stays the same, C) The products have the same molecules as the reactants” – correct: B. Short answer: Explain in your own words what happens to atoms during a chemical reaction (Expect: They rearrange to form new substances, but none are lost or gained)."
Chemistry,NSI,Unit 8: Reactivity of Metals and Non-metals (Reaktivite Materyèl Metalik ak Ki Pa Metalik),Entwodiksyon sou Reaktivite Materyèl (Introduction to Material Reactivity),"Learning Objectives: Explain what “reactivity” means in a chemical context (how readily a substance undergoes a chemical reaction); distinguish general reactivity trends of metals (meto) versus non-metals (ki pa metalik); introduce the concept of the activity series of metals (most reactive to least reactive) qualitatively .
Key Concepts: Chemical reactivity (reaktivite chimik): a measure of how easily a substance reacts. Highly reactive substances react vigorously (even spontaneously), while less reactive ones react slowly or require certain conditions, and very unreactive ones (like noble metals e.g. gold) hardly react at all. Metals vs Non-metals: Metals tend to react by losing electrons (forming cations), non-metals by gaining electrons (forming anions) or sharing electrons. In general, the activity series of metals ranks them: e.g. potassium, sodium very reactive (even with water/air), magnesium, zinc moderate, iron slower, copper, silver low reactivity, gold, platinum very low reactivity (do not corrode easily). Non-metals have varied behaviors: for example, halogens (like chlorine) are very reactive (gain electrons easily), whereas noble gases are inert. Also mention physical indicators of reactivity in daily life: iron rusts (reactive with air/water), aluminum doesn’t rust through (forms protective coat, less reactive in that sense), a piece of sodium metal fizzles in water (very reactive). Emphasize safety: highly reactive materials can be dangerous (e.g. sodium in water catches fire).
Activities/Experiments: Reactivity thought exercise: Show students samples or images of different metals (sodium, calcium, iron, copper, gold) and have them predict which are more reactive based on their experiences (they may know sodium from videos or not, but iron vs gold they might guess). Then confirm by explaining/watching short video clips: sodium thrown in water (flames), iron in water (rust over weeks), gold in acid (doesn’t dissolve in simple acid). If possible, do a safe demo: place an iron nail and a piece of copper in vinegar (weak acid) – observe over a day or two: the iron might show rust spots or bubbles (if vinegar is warm), copper will show little change except maybe a slight tarnish cleaning. Another simple activity: Check household items for corrosion – e.g., compare an old iron nail (rusty) vs an aluminum can or foil (no rust, just dull oxide layer) vs a copper penny (maybe tarnished green if old) – discuss differences in reactivity with air. Students can leave steel wool exposed to air and moisture for a day to see rust (shows iron is reactive with oxygen), vs place a piece of copper wire next to it (copper barely changes).
Quiz/Assessment Ideas: Multiple choice: “Which metal is least likely to react with acid? A) Zinc, B) Magnesium, C) Gold” – correct: C) Gold. True/False: “Non-metal elements are generally more likely to gain electrons in reactions than metals” (True). Short answer: Why doesn’t a gold ring rust or corrode easily? (Because gold is a very low-reactivity metal; it does not readily react with oxygen or common acids). Matching: match substance to a relative reactivity description (e.g. sodium – very reactive, copper – low reactivity). Fill-in: “The series that ranks metals by their reactivity is called the ________” (activity series)."
Chemistry,NSI,Unit 8: Reactivity of Metals and Non-metals (Reaktivite Materyèl Metalik ak Ki Pa Metalik),Reaksyon ak Air (Oksijèn) ak Dlo (Reactions with Air (Oxygen) and Water),"Learning Objectives: Describe how different materials react with oxygen in air (oxidation, combustion, corrosion)  and with water ; compare fast reactions like burning with slow oxidation like rusting. Understand which metals react with water (especially very reactive metals) and how non-metals can also react with oxygen (e.g. combustion of non-metals such as sulfur).
Key Concepts: Reaction with oxygen (oksidasyon): Metals: some metals react readily with O₂ forming oxides. For example, iron + oxygen + moisture → iron oxide (rust, wouy) – a slow corrosion process; 4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃. Magnesium burns in air with a bright flame to form magnesium oxide (2Mg + O₂ → 2MgO). Sodium and potassium can ignite spontaneously in air (hence stored in oil). Less reactive metals like copper slowly form a tarnish (copper oxide green patina), and gold or platinum do not oxidize in air (stays shiny). Non-metals: many non-metals also react with oxygen; e.g. carbon (as charcoal) burns in air (C + O₂ → CO₂); sulfur burns with blue flame to sulfur dioxide (S + O₂ → SO₂). Combustion is a reaction with oxygen that releases energy (exothermic) – basically burning. Reaction with water: Very reactive metals (group 1 like sodium, potassium) react vigorously with water, producing hydrogen gas and metal hydroxide (e.g. 2Na + 2H₂O → 2NaOH + H₂↑ with heat, often igniting the H₂). Calcium reacts with water more gently, forming Ca(OH)₂ and H₂ gas. Iron reacts very slowly with water (but presence of oxygen leads to rust). Non-metals: few non-metal elements react directly with water; however chlorine (a non-metal gas) reacts with water to form acids (HCl and HOCl). Also mention that some non-metal compounds like acidic oxides (CO₂) react with water to form acids (CO₂ + H₂O → H₂CO₃). Emphasize gas production (H₂) as a sign for reactive metals in water.
Activities/Experiments: Show videos/demonstrations of metals reacting with water: a small piece of sodium in water (it skates on surface, may catch fire – producing hydrogen which may pop). If live demo under safe conditions: calcium metal granules in water (it will fizz hydrogen slowly, water turns milky from Ca(OH)₂). Rusting experiment continuation: Students observe rust forming on iron (water + oxygen needed). They can set up two nails – one in water open to air, one completely submerged in boiled water with a layer of oil on top (no air) – after a few days, the one with air rusts, the one without air doesn’t, showing oxygen’s role. Non-metal in oxygen: perhaps burn a small piece of charcoal (carbon) or candle (mostly carbon/hydrogen) to show non-metal combustion (produces CO₂ which could be bubbled in limewater to test – turns it cloudy, proving reaction). Another demonstration: burn sulfur in air (if possible in lab, produces SO₂ with a pungent smell – caution!). Water reactivity series test: if possible, drop pieces of Zn, Fe, Cu in water and observe that nothing obvious happens at room temp (maybe tiny bubbles on Zn after long time, but not much). Possibly add a bit of acid to speed, but that’s next video’s topic.
Quiz/Assessment Ideas: Ask which metal requires storage under oil due to reacting with air moisture (Sodium or Potassium). True/False: “Iron will rust more quickly in salt water than in air alone” (True – electrolytes accelerate rust). Multiple-choice: “What gas is produced when sodium reacts with water? A) Oxygen, B) Hydrogen, C) Carbon dioxide” – correct: B) Hydrogen. Short answer: Give an example of a non-metal reacting with oxygen (expected: e.g. carbon burns in air to form CO₂, or sulfur to SO₂). Fill in: “When magnesium burns in air, the bright white product formed is magnesium ______” (oxide, MgO)."
Chemistry,NSI,Unit 8: Reactivity of Metals and Non-metals (Reaktivite Materyèl Metalik ak Ki Pa Metalik),Reaksyon ak Asid (Reactions with Acids),"Learning Objectives: Observe and understand how materials react with acids , focusing on metals and carbonate compounds. Know the general reaction: metal + acid → salt + hydrogen gas; carbonate + acid → salt + CO₂ gas + water. Identify which metals react strongly with acids and which do not. Recognize evidence of acid reactions (bubbling from gas release).
Key Concepts: Metals with acids: Many metals react with dilute acids like hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) to produce hydrogen gas (gaz idwojèn) and a dissolved salt. Example: Zn + 2HCl → ZnCl₂ + H₂↑ (bubbles of H₂ can be seen; the gas pops with a flame). Metals above hydrogen in the reactivity series (like Mg, Zn, Fe) will displace hydrogen from acids; metals below hydrogen (Cu, Ag, Au) will not react with dilute acids (e.g. copper does not react with HCl). The curriculum specifically notes: the reaction of vinegar (weak acetic acid) or lemon juice (citric acid) with chalk (calcium carbonate) . Carbonates with acids: e.g. CaCO₃ (chalk, limestone, eggshell) + 2HCl → CaCl₂ + CO₂↑ + H₂O. This produces carbon dioxide gas (detected by bubbling/fizzing that can extinguish a flame or turn limewater cloudy). This reaction is why vinegar on baking soda (sodium bicarbonate, a carbonate) fizzes – it releases CO₂. Non-metal elements generally do not react directly with acids (you need a compound like a carbonate to see something), but some non-metal compounds (like sulfides) with acid can release gases (rotten egg smell H₂S from sulfide + acid, but that’s advanced). Emphasize safety: acids can corrode metals – this is why, for instance, acid rain damages metal structures and limestone statues.
Activities/Experiments: Acid-metal reaction demo: Place a piece of zinc or a few iron filings in dilute hydrochloric acid (or use muriatic acid carefully). Students observe bubbling (H₂ gas). Capture gas in a test tube and do the “pop” test with a flame to show it’s hydrogen. If HCl is not available, use common acids: vinegar or lemon juice with a more reactive metal like magnesium ribbon (from a science kit) – vinegar is weak so reaction is slower, but magnesium might still produce slow bubbles of H₂. Acid-carbonate demo: Put a piece of chalk or crushed eggshell (CaCO₃) in vinegar – observe fizzing (CO₂ release) . To test CO₂, funnel the gas through tubing into limewater (if available) to see it turn milky. Students can do baking soda + vinegar at home (safe and dramatic foaming) to see the CO₂. Compare metals: Drop different metals in acid (magnesium, iron, copper) – magnesium fizz vigorously, iron slower, copper no reaction in dilute acid – rank their reactivity. Connect to real life: drop a tarnished penny (mostly copper) in vinegar + salt; it cleans the oxide but doesn’t produce hydrogen gas because copper isn’t dissolving significantly without stronger oxidizer – however, the cleaning shows acid removing copper oxide.
Quiz/Assessment Ideas: Ask “What gas is produced when an acid reacts with limestone (calcium carbonate)?” (CO₂). Multiple choice: “Which metal will NOT produce hydrogen gas when placed in dilute HCl? A) Zinc, B) Iron, C) Gold, D) Magnesium” – correct: C) Gold. True/False: “All metals react with acids to produce hydrogen.” (False – less reactive metals like copper, silver do not). Short answer: Write a word equation for the reaction of zinc with hydrochloric acid (zinc + hydrochloric acid → zinc chloride + hydrogen gas). Or: Explain why vinegar and baking soda fizz when mixed (acid + carbonate yields CO₂ gas)."
Chemistry,NSI,Unit 8: Reactivity of Metals and Non-metals (Reaktivite Materyèl Metalik ak Ki Pa Metalik),Reaksyon ak Baz ak Sèl (Reactions with Bases and Salts),"Learning Objectives: Investigate how certain materials react with bases (alkalis)  and how some metals or non-metals react with salt solutions (displacement reactions) . Understand the concept of amphoteric behavior (some metals react with both acids and bases) using aluminum as an example. Recognize a classic gas released by base reactions: ammonia (from ammonium compounds + base).
Key Concepts: Metals and bases: Most metals do not react with bases (since metals form positive ions and so do bases in solution, they typically don’t react). However, amphoteric metals like aluminum, zinc can react with strong bases. For example, aluminum reacts with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in presence of water to produce sodium aluminate and hydrogen gas: 2Al + 2NaOH + 6H₂O → 2Na[Al(OH)₄] + 3H₂↑ . The experiment list mentions reaction of Al with NaOH producing H₂  – demonstration of amphoteric behavior. Ammonium salts with base: e.g. ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) – yields ammonia gas (NH₃), water, and salt: NH₄Cl + NaOH → NaCl + NH₃↑ + H₂O . Ammonia gas has a pungent smell and turns red litmus blue (basic gas). This reaction illustrates how a base can release a gaseous base (ammonia) from a salt. Metal displacement (salt reactions): A more reactive metal can displace a less reactive metal from its salt solution. Example: Fe + CuSO₄ → FeSO₄ + Cu (iron nail in copper sulfate solution will get coated with copper) . Similarly, Cu + 2AgNO₃ → Cu(NO₃)₂ + 2Ag (copper wire in silver nitrate solution yields silver crystals) – actually shown in stoichiometry lab. These are reactions of a metal with a salt of another metal; they occur if the free metal is higher in the activity series than the metal in the compound. Non-metal displacement is also possible (e.g. a more reactive halogen displaces a less reactive halogen from its salt, like chlorine gas passed through potassium bromide solution yields bromine). But focus on metals for now. Summarize: some salts + base produce new salt + something else (like NH₃), and more reactive metal + salt of less reactive metal → new salt + less reactive metal out.
Activities/Experiments: Base + aluminum demo: Add pieces of aluminum foil to a beaker of warm drain cleaner (NaOH solution). Observe bubbles of hydrogen and that aluminum dissolves over time (caution: do in well-ventilated area, wear gloves). If available, illustrate ammonia release: mix ammonium chloride (or even household ammonia + salt?) Actually better: take a bit of ammonium-based fertilizer (e.g. ammonium sulfate) with baking soda (a base) and a bit of water – see if ammonia smell is detectable (or warm gently, smell cautiously). Or simpler, just open a bottle of household ammonia (already NH₃ solution) to recognize the smell, explaining that’s the gas bases can release from ammonium salts. Metal displacement demo: Soak an iron nail in copper sulfate solution for 10-20 minutes – it will get a reddish coating of copper while the blue solution fades (Fe displacing Cu). Students can do this if given small cups and some copper sulfate (which is often available as an algicide or root killer). Alternatively, use a penny and a solution of silver nitrate (teacher demo: the copper penny gets silver crystals, solution turns blue from Cu²⁺). If possible, have students attempt to clean tarnished silver with aluminum foil + baking soda in hot water – that’s a real-life redox reaction where aluminum (more reactive) reduces silver sulfide tarnish back to silver. This ties an everyday trick to reactivity (Al displaces Ag from a compound).
Quiz/Assessment Ideas: Question: “Mixing ammonium chloride with a strong base releases a gas with a strong smell. What is that gas?” (Ammonia, NH₃). True/False: “Copper metal will displace zinc from zinc sulfate solution” (False – copper is less reactive than zinc). Multiple-choice: “Which of the following metals will produce hydrogen gas when boiled with a strong base like NaOH? A) Gold, B) Aluminum, C) Iron” – correct: B) Aluminum (amphoteric behavior). Fill-in: “When an iron nail is placed in a copper(II) sulfate solution, the nail becomes coated with ____” (copper metal). Short answer: Describe what you would observe when a piece of aluminum foil is added to a solution of sodium hydroxide (Expected: The aluminum will gradually dissolve and bubbles of hydrogen gas will form)."
Chemistry,NSI,Unit 9: Atomic Theory and Atomic Structure (Teyori Atomik ak Estrikti Atòm),Istwa Modèl Atomik (History of Atomic Models),"Learning Objectives: Trace the development of atomic theory through historical models ; understand how scientific models of the atom changed as new evidence emerged. Identify key atomic models: Dalton’s solid sphere, Thomson’s plum pudding, Rutherford’s nuclear model, Bohr’s planetary model, and qualitatively mention the modern quantum model.
Key Concepts: Ancient idea: Democritus (~400 BC) proposed that matter is made of indivisible particles called “atomos,” but it was philosophical. Dalton’s model (1803): Atom as a solid, indivisible sphere; Dalton’s atomic theory said atoms of each element are identical and combine in whole-number ratios. Thomson’s model (1897): Discovery of the electron (by J.J. Thomson’s cathode ray experiments) led to the “plum pudding” model – electrons (negative particles) embedded in a positive “pudding,” like raisins in a bun. Rutherford’s model (1911): Gold foil experiment showed a tiny, dense, positive nucleus in the center of the atom with electrons around and mostly empty space (most alpha particles passed through foil, a few deflected strongly) . So atom = nucleus (protons + later neutrons) and electrons orbiting far out. Bohr’s model (1913): Electrons orbit the nucleus in fixed energy levels (shells); explained hydrogen’s spectral lines. Electrons can jump between levels absorbing/emitting energy (like planets orbiting at certain distances). Modern quantum model (1920s–): electrons exist in probabilistic orbitals (clouds) rather than fixed orbits; dual wave-particle nature. We can mention this in simple terms (cloud model) but not go deep into quantum mechanics. Emphasize how each model solved problems of the previous: Thomson found atoms have parts (electrons), Rutherford found structure (nucleus vs electrons), Bohr explained electron energy levels. Possibly mention Chadwick (1932) added neutrons in nucleus. Use analogies or diagrams to help conceptualize each model.
Activities/Experiments: Timeline activity: Students create a timeline with sketches of each atomic model and a one-line description. Alternatively, assign each student or group a model or scientist to research briefly (Dalton, Thomson, Rutherford, Bohr, etc.) and present one key experiment or idea in simple terms (they can do this in Haitian Creole, ensuring understanding). Simulation/animation: Show a short animation of the gold foil experiment results or Bohr model transitions (there are simple simulations of Rutherford scattering and Bohr orbits online that can be shown via video). Model building: Have students draw or build a series of simple models: e.g. a Dalton model (solid ball), a Thomson model (sphere with pom-pom “electrons” stuck in), Rutherford model (tiny ball nucleus in center of a large clear sphere for electron region), Bohr model (nucleus with rings for orbits and electrons on them). They can use craft materials for a hands-on representation.
Quiz/Assessment Ideas: Matching: match each scientist to their model description (Dalton – indivisible sphere, Thomson – plum pudding, Rutherford – nucleus and empty space, Bohr – electrons in orbits). True/False: “Rutherford’s gold foil experiment proved that an atom is mostly empty space” (True). Multiple-choice: “Which atomic model was the first to include electrons? A) Dalton, B) Thomson, C) Rutherford” – correct: B) Thomson. Short answer: Why did the plum pudding model need to be revised according to Rutherford’s findings? (Alpha particles mostly passed through gold foil, indicating most of atom is empty with mass concentrated in nucleus – contradicting plum pudding which had mass spread out)."
Chemistry,NSI,Unit 9: Atomic Theory and Atomic Structure (Teyori Atomik ak Estrikti Atòm),Konpozisyon Atòm – Patikil Subatomik (Composition of the Atom – Subatomic Particles),"Learning Objectives: Identify and describe the three main subatomic particles: proton, neutron, electron  – including their charge, relative mass, and location in the atom. Define atomic number (Z) as the number of protons (which determines the element) , and mass number (A) as the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. Understand that in a neutral atom, number of protons = number of electrons.
Key Concepts: Proton (pwoton): positively charged (+1) particle in the nucleus; relative mass ~1 atomic mass unit (amu) . Neutron (netwon): neutral (0 charge) particle in the nucleus; mass ~1 amu (slightly heavier than proton) . Electron (elektwon): negatively charged (–1) particle moving around the nucleus in electron cloud or energy levels; relative mass ~1/1836 amu (very tiny) . The nucleus (protons + neutrons) carries almost all the atom’s mass and a positive charge, while electrons occupy most of the volume with negative charge balancing the protons. Atomic number (nonm atomik, Z): number of protons in the nucleus; defines the element (e.g. carbon Z=6 means 6 protons) . Mass number (A): protons + neutrons; e.g. carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. Isotopes (to be detailed in next video) are atoms of same Z but different A (different neutrons). A neutral atom has equal protons and electrons; if electrons differ, it becomes an ion (not focus now, but mention: more electrons = negative ion, fewer = positive ion). The size of nucleus is extremely small compared to the atom’s size. Possibly mention simple notation: ${Z}^{A}\text{X}$ for an atom (like ${6}^{12}\text{C}$). Emphasize: chemical behavior depends on electrons, element identity on protons, neutrons add mass and some nuclear properties but not change element.
Activities/Experiments: Subatomic particle counting practice: Give students some information and have them determine proton, neutron, electron counts. For example: “Oxygen-16 atom” – atomic number 8 (so 8 protons), mass number 16 (so 16-8 = 8 neutrons), neutral atom so 8 electrons. Or “Cl⁻ ion with mass number 35” – Cl atomic number 17: 17 protons, 18 neutrons, as an ion with -1 charge it has 18 electrons. Students can use a periodic table to look up atomic numbers and practice. Build an atom model: Using colored balls or paper circles: assign a color to protons, neutrons, electrons. For a given element (say carbon or sodium), have them assemble a nucleus with the correct number of protons/neutrons, and place electrons in rings/cloud around it. This can be a craft activity to reinforce composition. Visualization: Show a graphic comparing the scale: if an atom was a stadium, nucleus is a pea on the field, electrons are like flies in the stands – illustrates empty space and relative sizes. Possibly use PhET “Build an Atom” simulation or similar interactive where students can add protons/neutrons/electrons and see how the element, charge, and mass change.
Quiz/Assessment Ideas: Fill-in: “Protons have a ______ charge, electrons have a ______ charge, neutrons have ______ charge.” (positive, negative, no). Multiple choice: “If an atom has 7 protons, 7 neutrons, and 7 electrons, what is its atomic number?” – A) 7, B) 14, C) 21 (correct: 7). True/False: “All atoms of the same element have the same number of protons” (True). Calculation: “An atom has atomic number 12 and mass number 25. How many neutrons does it have?” (13 neutrons). Short answer: What makes an oxygen atom different from a nitrogen atom? (O has 8 protons, N has 7 protons – different atomic numbers define different elements)."
Chemistry,NSI,Unit 9: Atomic Theory and Atomic Structure (Teyori Atomik ak Estrikti Atòm),"Nimewo Atomik, Izotòp ak Màs Atomik Mwayèn (Atomic Number, Isotopes, and Average Atomic Mass)","Learning Objectives: Reinforce that atomic number (Z) defines the element ; explain what isotopes (izotòp) are – atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons ; give examples of common isotopes (like Carbon-12, Carbon-14) and note their properties (some isotopes are stable, some are radioactive). Teach how to calculate the average atomic mass of an element given the percent abundance of its isotopes , and relate this to the atomic weight on the periodic table.
Key Concepts: Isotopes: same number of protons, different number of neutrons. They have the same atomic number but different mass numbers. Denote as Element-Mass (e.g. Carbon-14 or $^{14}$C). Isotopes of an element have almost identical chemical behavior (since electrons/protons same) but can differ in stability (some decay radioactively) and mass. Examples: Hydrogen has protium $^1$H (1 proton, 0 neutrons), deuterium $^2$H (1 proton, 1 neutron), tritium $^3$H (radioactive, 1 proton, 2 neutrons). Carbon-12 vs Carbon-14 (C-14 is radioactive, used in dating). Natural abundance: elements often exist as a mix of isotopes. Average atomic mass (mas atomik mwayèn): the weighted average of all isotopes’ masses according to their natural abundance on Earth. For example, chlorine’s atomic mass ~35.45 u because chlorine is ~75% Cl-35 and 25% Cl-37 in nature . Calculation: (0.75×35) + (0.25×37) = 35.5. This average is the number shown in periodic table for atomic weight. Emphasize that for most elements, atomic mass on the table is not a whole number due to isotope mix. Another example: Copper ~63.5 because Cu-63 (~69%) and Cu-65 (~31%). If needed, mention that number of neutrons = mass number - atomic number; isotopes are often written as $_{Z}^{A}\text{X}$ or X-A. Connect back to radioactivity: many radioactive elements are isotopes (like C-14, U-235, U-238), linking to earlier radioactivity lesson.
Activities/Experiments: Grouping isotopes activity: Give students cards representing different isotopes of a few elements (e.g. 3 cards: Carbon-12, Carbon-13, Carbon-14; 2 cards: Oxygen-16, Oxygen-18; etc.). Have them group cards by element (showing they recognize same proton number) and order by mass. Discuss which are stable vs radioactive (if known: C-14 radioactive, others stable). Average mass calculation practice: Provide a simple set of isotopes with abundances for students to calculate atomic mass. For instance: “Element X has two isotopes: X-10 (mass 10 u, 20% abundance) and X-11 (mass 11 u, 80% abundance). Calculate average atomic mass.” (0.210 + 0.811 = 10.8 u). Use real data for one element (like chlorine or magnesium) and have them do the weighted average calculation. Maybe use pennies analogy: older pennies (heavier) vs newer (lighter) average mass. Demonstration: not much hands-on with isotopes, but you can show a periodic table and identify elements with near-integer atomic masses (means one dominant isotope, e.g. F ~19.0) versus those with .5 (mix of two isotopes like Cl). If resources: use a model kit to build two atoms of the same element with different neutrons (just conceptual).
Quiz/Assessment Ideas: Multiple choice: “Isotopes of an element have different: A) numbers of protons, B) chemical symbols, C) mass numbers, D) atomic numbers” – correct: C) mass numbers (different neutrons). True/False: “Carbon-14 and Carbon-12 have the same chemical properties” (True, largely the same chemistry). Calculation: “Gallium has two stable isotopes: Ga-69 (60.1% abundance, mass 68.93 u) and Ga-71 (39.9% abundance, mass 70.92 u). Calculate the average atomic mass of Ga.” (Expected ~69.72 u, matching periodic table). Fill-in: “The atomic number of an element equals the number of ______ in its atoms” (protons). Short answer: If an element’s atomic weight on the periodic table is not a whole number, explain why. (Because it is an average of weights of all naturally occurring isotopes of that element, weighted by their abundance)."
Chemistry,NSII,Unit 1: Structure of Matter (Estrikti Matyè),:,"Eta Solid, Likid ak Gaz (States of Matter)
Learning Objectives:
Describe the distinguishing characteristics of solids, liquids, and gases (形态固体, 液体, 气体).
Compare the shape and volume of matter in each physical state.
Identify examples of solids, liquids, and gases in everyday life and their uses.
Key Concepts:
Solids (sòlid): Have a fixed shape and volume due to tightly packed particles in a rigid structure. Solids do not easily change shape – e.g. a rock remains the same shape in any container .
Liquids (likid): Have a definite volume but no fixed shape. They take the shape of their container (non-rigid structure) because particles can slide past one another . For example, water will assume the shape of any cup or bottle it’s poured into.
Gases (gaz): Have no fixed shape or volume. Gases expand to fill their container and are highly compressible, because particles are far apart and move freely . For instance, air will spread out to fill a room, and you can compress air in a syringe or pump.
Particle arrangement: In solids, particles are tightly packed in an orderly lattice; in liquids, particles are close but disordered; in gases, particles are widely spaced and move randomly. These microscopic structures explain macroscopic properties (solids are rigid, liquids flow, gases compressible)  .
Concrete examples: Ice (solid) keeps its shape; liquid water takes the shape of its bottle; water vapor (gas) spreads out in the air. Many materials can change state with temperature (e.g. ice melting to water, water boiling to steam). These changes are physical changes of state.
Activities:
Shape of Liquids vs Solids: Pour an equal volume of water into containers of different shapes (glass, bowl, bottle) and observe how the liquid water takes each container’s shape . Then place a solid object (e.g. a rock or piece of wood) into different containers – note that its shape remains unchanged (illustrating a solid’s rigid structure) . Discuss why liquids adapt shape while solids do not.
Compressing a Gas: Using a syringe (no needle) or a bicycle pump, trap a small amount of air and press the plunger. Observe that the air compresses (plunger moves in) and springs back when released – evidence of large spaces between gas particles that allow compression. Compare with trying to compress a syringe full of water (incompressible liquid).
Everyday Examples Hunt: Have students list or find examples at home of each state of matter (e.g., solid: a metal spoon, liquid: cooking oil, gas: steam from a kettle). For each, ask them to describe its shape and volume characteristics. This reinforces recognition of states in daily life.
Quiz/Assessment Ideas:
Concept check: “Which state of matter has a definite volume but no definite shape?” (Answer: Liquid).
True/False: “Gases expand to fill any container they are put in.” (True – gases have no fixed volume).
Short answer: Provide a scenario – “A student pours 100 mL of a substance into a cylinder. It fills the bottom and takes the cylinder’s shape. What state is it, and how do you know?” (Expected: It’s a liquid, because it takes the container’s shape but has a specific volume).
Identify state: Show images (or descriptions) of substances (e.g. a bar of gold, a cup of milk, helium in a balloon) and ask students to identify which is solid/liquid/gas and justify their choice.
Explanation: “Why can you easily squeeze (compress) a balloon full of air, but not a water-filled balloon?” – Students should explain in terms of particle spacing (gas particles far apart vs liquid particles closely packed)."
Chemistry,NSII,Unit 1: Structure of Matter (Estrikti Matyè),:,"Modèl Patikil ak Estrikti Matière (Particle Model of Matter)
Learning Objectives:
Interpret the macroscopic properties of solids, liquids, and gases in terms of a microscopic particle model .
Describe how particle arrangement and motion differ in the three states (solid, liquid, gas).
Apply the particle model to explain phenomena like compressibility of gas, fluidity of liquid, rigidity of solid.
Understand that matter is made of particles (atoms or molecules) in constant motion (Kinetic Molecular Theory basics).
Key Concepts:
Matter is particulate: All matter is composed of tiny particles (atoms or molecules) that are in constant motion. The spacing and movement of these particles differ by state.
Solid structure (mikwoskopik): Particles in a solid are tightly packed in a fixed, orderly arrangement. They vibrate in place but do not change positions. This explains why solids hold a definite shape and are not easily compressible – the particles are already as close together as possible.
Liquid structure: Particles in a liquid are close together but not in fixed positions – they can move/slide around each other. This fluid particle arrangement explains why liquids flow and take the shape of a container while maintaining volume. Particles in liquids are still not easily compressible because there is little free space between them (though slightly more than in solids).
Gas structure: Particles in a gas are far apart, moving rapidly and randomly. There are large empty spaces between particles. This explains gas properties: compressibility (particles can be pushed closer, reducing volume) and expansibility (gas spreads out to fill available space) . Gases have neither fixed shape nor volume because particles move independently and fill the container.
Kinetic energy and motion: In solids, particle motion is limited to vibrations; in liquids, particles have more kinetic energy, moving and sliding around; in gases, particles have high kinetic energy, moving freely at high speeds. Higher temperature means particles move faster (in any state).
Macro-micro link: The particle model allows us to explain everyday observations: e.g., gas pressure is particles hitting container walls; a solid’s hardness or rigidity comes from locked particle positions; a liquid’s ability to pour comes from particles exchanging places.
Activities:
Human Particle Simulation: (Virtual or group activity) Students pretend to be particles: stand tightly in formation to model a solid (only allow small in-place “vibrations”), then loosen up and slide past each other for a liquid, then spread far apart and move freely for a gas. This kinesthetic activity connects particle motion to state properties.
Marbles in a Box (model): Use a small box with marbles or beads to simulate particles. For a solid, fill the box so marbles are tightly packed (they jiggle but are constrained). For a liquid, only half-fill the box – marbles can flow/roll past each other. For a gas, use a larger box with just a few marbles – shake it so marbles fly around and rarely collide. Discuss how each scenario represents particle behavior in different states.
Compression demo: Revisit the syringe experiment with a particle perspective. Draw a diagram of particles in the syringe for air vs water. Students add arrows to show what happens when pushing the plunger (air particles have space to move closer, water particles are already close so they resist compression).
Research/animation: Watch a short animation of particles in solid, liquid, gas (if available online). Alternatively, assign a mini-research: find an image or simulation of particle arrangements and write a sentence on how it explains a property (e.g., “I found that in a solid, particles form a pattern – this explains why a crystal has a fixed shape”).
Quiz/Assessment Ideas:
Diagram labeling: Provide sketches of particle arrangements (one closely packed and ordered, one slightly disordered but close, one very spread out). Ask students to label which is solid, liquid, gas and justify their choice.
Explanation question: “Why does a gas fill the entire volume of its container, according to the particle model?” (Expected: Particles in a gas move freely and are far apart, so they spread until uniformly distributed throughout the container).
Multiple choice: “In which state are particles moving the fastest? A) Solid, B) Liquid, C) Gas.” (C – gas).
True/False: “Particles in a liquid are not moving.” (False – they move around each other, just slower than in gas).
Short answer: “Using the particle model, explain why liquids flow but solids do not.” (Liquids have particles that can slide past each other due to a looser arrangement; solid particles are locked in place, preventing flow)."
Chemistry,NSII,Unit 2: Atomic Structure (Estrikti Atòm),:,"Konpozisyon Atòm ak Patikil Subatomik (Atomic Composition & Subatomic Particles)
Learning Objectives:
Describe the basic structure of an atom (nucleus and electron cloud) and identify its subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, electrons.
State the properties of protons, neutrons, and electrons (relative charge, mass, and location within the atom).
Define atomic number (nonm atomik) and mass number and explain how they relate to protons, neutrons, and electrons .
Determine the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in a given atom or ion (using atomic number and mass number).
Understand that atoms of the same element have the same number of protons, while isotopes differ in neutrons.
Key Concepts:
Atom structure: An atom consists of a tiny, dense nucleus at the center, surrounded by a cloud of electrons. The nucleus contains protons (positively charged particles) and neutrons (neutral particles). Electrons (negatively charged) move in the space around the nucleus.
Subatomic particles:
Proton (p⁺): Charge +1, mass ~1 atomic mass unit (amu). The number of protons defines the element (this is the atomic number Z). For example, carbon has 6 protons (Z=6), oxygen has 8.
Neutron (n⁰): Charge 0, mass ~1 amu (slightly more than a proton). Neutrons add mass but not charge. Atoms of the same element can have different neutron counts – these are isotopes (e.g., Carbon-12 vs Carbon-14).
Electron (e⁻): Charge –1, mass ~0.0005 amu (approximately 1/2000 of a proton’s mass). Electrons occupy the space around the nucleus in various energy levels. In a neutral atom, number of electrons equals number of protons, balancing charge.
Atomic number (Z, nonm atomik): The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom . This is unique for each element and appears on the periodic table. (For a neutral atom, Z also equals the number of electrons.) Example: Z=1 for hydrogen (1 proton), Z=8 for oxygen.
Mass number (A): The total number of protons + neutrons in the nucleus. For example, an atom of oxygen might have 8 protons and 8 neutrons, giving mass number A = 16. (Electrons have negligible mass so they don’t significantly contribute to A.)
Isotopes: Atoms of the same element (same Z) but different mass numbers (different neutrons). Example: Chlorine-35 and Chlorine-37 both have 17 protons, but one has 18 neutrons and the other 20. Chemically they behave similarly, but isotope masses differ.
Size and scale: The nucleus is extremely small (about 100,000 times smaller than the atom’s size) yet contains almost all the atom’s mass. Electrons are tiny and occupy a much larger volume in their orbitals, which explains why atoms are mostly empty space.
Charge balance: In a neutral atom, #protons = #electrons (so positive and negative charges cancel). If electrons are lost or gained, the atom becomes an ion (cation if positive, anion if negative). For example, Na atom (11p, 11e) losing 1e⁻ becomes Na⁺ (11p, 10e).
Activities:
Build an Atom Model: Using simple materials (e.g., colored balls/beads for particles), construct a model of a small atom. Use one color bead for protons, another for neutrons, and smaller ones for electrons. Place protons and neutrons together (nucleus) and arrange “electrons” in orbits around. For example, build a model of a carbon atom with 6 protons (perhaps red beads), 6 neutrons (blue beads) in a cluster, and 6 electrons (small yellow beads) on two orbit circles (2 in the first shell, 4 in the second). This concrete model helps visualize atomic structure.
Periodic Table Detective: Give students a periodic table (or element cards). Have them pick an element and determine the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons for a typical atom. For mass number, use the nearest whole number of the atomic weight (e.g., Magnesium atomic weight ~24.3, so common isotope Mg-24 has 12 protons, 12 neutrons). Practice with a few elements: “If an atom has atomic number 12 and mass number 25, how many neutrons does it have?” (13 neutrons, since 25–12).
Isotope Bean Counter: Simulate isotopes using beans or coins. Label a cup “Element X – Atomic #5” (meaning 5 protons always). Fill with 5 red beans (protons), 5 blue beans (neutrons). That’s isotope with mass 10. To simulate another isotope, replace two blue beans with two other color (say green) to represent extra neutrons – now mass 12. Count protons and neutrons to see difference. This reinforces that protons stay same but neutrons differ.
Charge and Ion Game: Give students a certain # of proton and electron cut-outs. Example: 9 proton cards, 9 electron cards (this is neutral fluorine). Ask what happens if the atom loses one electron card (becomes F⁺ ion with 9p, 8e) or gains one (F⁻ ion with 9p, 10e). They should state the resulting net charge. This shows how atoms form ions by electron transfer.
Quiz/Assessment Ideas:
Fill-in-the-blank: “Protons have a ____ charge and reside in the ____. Electrons have a ____ charge and reside in the ____.” (Answer: positive, nucleus; negative, electron cloud/orbitals).
Quick calc: “Element X has atomic number 7 and mass number 15. How many neutrons in its nucleus?” (8 neutrons, since 15–7=8).
Multiple choice: “Which two particles have approximately the same mass? A) Proton & Electron, B) Proton & Neutron, C) Neutron & Electron.” (B – proton & neutron).
Identify element: “An atom has 8 protons, 8 neutrons, 8 electrons. What element is it?” (Oxygen, atomic number 8). “If this atom gains two electrons, what is the charge of the ion?” (O²⁻).
True/False: “Isotopes of an element have different numbers of protons.” (False – isotopes differ in neutrons, not protons).
Short answer: “Explain why the atomic number uniquely identifies an element.” (Because atomic number = number of protons, and each element has a fixed proton count that no other element shares)."

Learning Objectives:
Explain how electrons in an atom are arranged in energy levels (shells) and sublevels/orbitals around the nucleus.
Write the basic electron configuration for the first 20 elements, and identify the valence electrons (electrons in the outermost shell).
Define “orbital” and recognize the types (s, p, d, f) in a qualitative way . (Kreyòl: òbital s, p, d, f).
Understand the concept of the valence shell and why valence electrons determine chemical properties and bonding.
Predict an element’s group (family) and period on the periodic table from its electron configuration (e.g., an atom with configuration 2-8-1 is in Group 1, Period 3).
Key Concepts:
Energy levels (kouch enèji): Electrons occupy specific energy levels (also called shells) around the nucleus, labeled n=1, 2, 3, etc. The lower-numbered shells are closer to the nucleus and lower in energy; higher shells are farther out and higher energy. Each shell can hold a limited number of electrons: e.g., first shell up to 2, second up to 8, third up to 18, etc. (2n² rule for capacity).
Electron configuration: This is a notation that shows the distribution of electrons among shells and subshells. For example, the configuration of sodium (Z=11) is 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s¹ – meaning 2 electrons in 1s orbital, 2 in 2s, 6 in 2p, and 1 in 3s. In simpler terms, we can summarize by shell: sodium has 2 in the first shell, 8 in the second, 1 in the third (often written as 2-8-1).
Orbitals and subshells: Each shell is subdivided into orbitals of types s, p, d, f. An orbital is a region of space where an electron is likely to be found.
The first shell has only an s orbital (1s).
The second shell has an s (2s) and p orbitals (2p).
The third shell has s (3s), p (3p), and d (3d), and so on.
s-orbital: holds up to 2 e⁻ (spherical shape); p-orbitals: up to 6 e⁻ total (3 dumbbell-shaped orbitals ×2 each); d-orbitals: up to 10 e⁻ (5 orbitals ×2 each); f: up to 14 e⁻ (7 orbitals ×2).
Orbital shapes (optional depth): s orbitals are spherical, p orbitals are dumbbell-shaped, etc. These shapes come from quantum mechanics and were researched by students as per curriculum , but for NS II we focus on how many electrons each can hold and their order.
Filling order: Electrons fill the lowest energy orbitals first (Aufbau principle). Roughly: 1s < 2s < 2p < 3s < 3p < 4s < 3d < 4p < 5s… etc. This dictates the electron configuration sequence.
Valence electrons: The electrons in the outermost occupied shell of an atom. These are crucial because they participate in chemical bonding and reactions. For example, carbon has 4 valence electrons (configuration 2-4), oxygen has 6 (2-6). The number of valence electrons corresponds to an element’s group on the periodic table, and the shell number corresponds to the period .
Link to Periodic Table: Elements in the same column (group) have the same number of valence electrons (hence similar properties), and elements in the same row (period) have the same number of shells. E.g., all Group 1 elements end in s¹ (one valence electron), all period 2 elements have 2 shells occupied.
Octet rule: Atoms tend to gain, lose, or share electrons to achieve a full valence shell (often 8 electrons for main-group elements, like a noble gas configuration). This is a guiding principle for bonding behavior. For instance, Na (2-8-1) tends to lose 1 electron to have 2-8 (Neon configuration), whereas Cl (2-8-7) tends to gain 1 to achieve 2-8-8.
Activities:
Orbital Diagram Challenge: Give students a few elements (e.g. H, He, Li, C, Ne, Mg, etc.) and ask them to draw a simple Bohr model or energy level diagram: draw the nucleus, then draw shells around with dots for electrons. For lithium (Z=3), they’d draw 2 electrons in the first shell, 1 in the second; for neon (Z=10), 2 in first, 8 in second, etc. This helps visualize shells and valence electrons.
Electron Configuration Practice: Have students write out configurations or shell distributions for elements up to Z=20. For example, prompt: “What is the electron configuration of phosphorus (Z=15)?” Expected: 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p³ (or shell notation 2-8-5). Have them identify valence electrons (5 in this case) and predict which group (Group 15) and period (Period 3) it belongs to.
Research orbital shapes (advanced): In small groups or individually, let students look up the shapes of s, p, d, f orbitals (via internet or textbook) . They can make a mini-poster or slide describing each type (in Kreyòl or French, as needed). This is an enrichment activity linking to the idea that electrons occupy 3D regions.
Valence Electron and Reactivity: Make a table with columns: Element, Electron configuration (shell form), Valence electrons, Likely ion formed. Students fill for a few examples: e.g., Na (2-8-1, 1 valence → loses 1 to form Na⁺); O (2-6, 6 valence → gains 2 to form O²⁻). This connects configuration to chemical behavior.
Card Sorting Game: Prepare cards that show either an element’s configuration or its identity (or position). Have students match them. E.g., one card says “2-8-2” and students must match it to “Magnesium (Mg, Group 2, Period 3)” or to a card that says “Group 2 element with 2 valence electrons in the 3rd shell.”
Quiz/Assessment Ideas:
Completion: “The electron configuration of Nitrogen (Z=7) is 1s² 2s² 2p³. How many electrons are in its outer shell?” (5 valence electrons). Follow-up: “Which group on the periodic table would nitrogen belong to?” (Group 15 or VA, since 5 valence e⁻).
Multiple choice: “Which of the following orbital types can hold a maximum of 6 electrons? A) s, B) p, C) d, D) f.” (B – p orbitals hold 6).
True/False: “All elements in Period 4 have electrons in the 4th shell.” (True – period number indicates highest occupied shell). “All elements in Group 1 have one electron in their outermost shell.” (True, by definition of group 1).
Short Answer: Give an element (say, Calcium). Ask: “Write its electron configuration or shell structure, and identify its valence electrons.” (Ca Z=20: 1s²2s²2p⁶3s²3p⁶4s², valence = 2 electrons in 4s). Then ask “What stable ion will calcium form?” (Ca²⁺, losing 2 e⁻).
Identify Element from Config: Present a configuration like “1s² 2s² 2p⁵”. Ask which element it is (Fluorine, Z=9) and how many more electrons it needs to fill its second shell (needs 1 more to have 2p⁶).
Orbital Knowledge (advanced): “Name the orbital type being filled for elements in the first two columns of the periodic table.” (s-orbital) “Name the orbital type filling for transition metals.” (d-orbitals). (This assesses recognition of orbital blocks: s-block, p-block, d-block, f-block)."
Chemistry,NSII,Unit 3: Periodic Table (Tablo Peryodik),:,"Òganizasyon Tablo Peryodik (Periodic Table Organization)
Learning Objectives:
Describe how the periodic table is arranged by increasing atomic number and in rows (periods) and columns (groups/families).
Explain what elements in the same group have in common (e.g., similar valence electron counts and chemical properties) and what elements in the same period share (same number of electron shells).
Identify the major categories of elements: metals, nonmetals, and metalloids, and locate them on the table.
Use the periodic table to deduce an element’s electron configuration, valence electrons, and likely chemical behavior (e.g., metal vs nonmetal, typical ion formed).
Recognize special element groups: e.g., Alkali metals (Group 1), Alkaline earths (Group 2), Halogens (Group 17), Noble gases (Group 18), and know their general characteristics.
Key Concepts:
Periodic table layout: Elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number (Z) from left to right, top to bottom. Each element’s square typically shows its atomic number, symbol, name, and atomic mass. This tabular arrangement highlights periodic patterns in properties.
Periods: Horizontal rows numbered 1 through 7 (in NS II, the first 4 or 5 periods are most relevant). All elements in a period have the same number of atomic shells. For example, Period 2 elements (Li through Ne) all have two electron shells. Properties gradually change across a period in a predictable way (like metals on left to nonmetals on right).
Groups/Families: Vertical columns numbered 1 to 18 (or labeled IA-VIIIA and transition groups). Elements in a group have similar chemical properties because they have the same number of valence electrons . For example, Group 17 (Halogens: F, Cl, Br, etc.) all have 7 valence electrons and are reactive nonmetals. Group 1 (Alkali metals: H sort of, Li, Na, K, etc.) all have 1 valence electron and are very reactive metals.
Valence and group: The group number (for main-group elements) often equals the number of valence electrons. E.g., Group 1 → 1 valence e⁻, Group 16 → 6 valence e⁻. (In the French system IA = 1, VA = 5, etc., but we can use the modern numbering 1–18 as needed, just noting main-group 1–2 and 13–18 correspond to valences 1–8).
Metals, Nonmetals, Metalloids:
Metals: Found on the left side and center of the table (about 2/3 of elements). They are typically shiny, good conductors of heat/electricity, malleable, and tend to lose electrons in reactions (forming cations). Examples: Iron (Fe), Sodium (Na).
Nonmetals: Found on the upper right side of the table. They are often poor conductors, not lustrous, and tend to gain or share electrons (forming anions or covalent bonds). Examples: Oxygen (O), Chlorine (Cl).
Metalloids (semi-metals): These elements border the zigzag line between metals and nonmetals (e.g., Si, Ge, As). They have intermediate properties – semiconductors of electricity, etc.
Notable families:
Alkali Metals (Groupe 1/Akali): Li, Na, K, etc. 1 valence electron, extremely reactive (especially with water), form +1 ions. Hydrogen is placed in group 1 but is a special nonmetal case.
Alkaline Earth Metals (Groupe 2): Be, Mg, Ca, etc. 2 valence electrons, reactive (but less so than group 1), form +2 ions.
Transition Metals (Groups 3–12): Metals that often have variable valences and form colored compounds (e.g. Fe, Cu, Ni). They fill d orbitals.
Halogens (Groupe 17/Halogènes): F, Cl, Br, I, etc. 7 valence electrons, very reactive nonmetals, typically form –1 ions (Cl⁻, etc.) or share electrons in covalent compounds. Often diatomic in elemental form (F₂, Cl₂…).
Noble Gases (Groupe 18/Gaz Noble): He, Ne, Ar, etc. 8 valence electrons (except He has 2), full outer shells, very stable and unreactive (inert). They exist as monatomic gases under normal conditions.
Periodic Law: The chemical and physical properties of elements show a repeating (periodic) pattern when elements are arranged by increasing atomic number. Elements in the same group behave similarly – this is why the table is so useful. Mendeleev’s insight was that these patterns allowed him to predict properties of undiscovered elements. Today, we know the periodic patterns arise from recurring electron configurations.
Examples from table: Carbon (Z=6) is in Group 14, Period 2 → it has 2 shells (period 2) and 4 valence e⁻ (group 14, so 4 in outer shell). It’s a nonmetal. Potassium (Z=19) is in Group 1, Period 4 → 4 shells, 1 valence e⁻, and is a highly reactive metal.
Activities:
Periodic Table Scavenger Hunt: Provide each student or group with a periodic table. Pose a series of questions that require navigating it. e.g., “Find the element in Period 3, Group 16” (should be Sulfur). “Which group contains very unreactive gases?” (Group 18, Noble gases). “Name two metalloids.” (Answers could be silicon, germanium, etc.). “What element has 5 valence electrons and 3 shells?” (That’s an element in Group 15, Period 3: Phosphorus). This activity builds familiarity with the table’s layout and meaning.
Group Properties Demonstration (Teacher or video): Show reactions of elements in the same group to emphasize similarity. If possible (and with caution), a teacher could demonstrate sodium (Group 1) reacting vigorously with water vs. potassium reacting even more vigorously – illustrating reactivity trend down Group 1. Alternatively, use video clips of alkali metals in water or halogens reacting, etc., to highlight group traits. (Students should not try these at home – teacher demo or video only!). Discuss why these similarities occur (same valence count).
Metal vs Nonmetal Testing: (Classroom or home with safe items) Provide small samples of different elements or materials (if pure elements available in a lab, or common items primarily composed of certain elements): e.g., a piece of aluminum foil (Al, metal), a piece of carbon graphite (pencil lead, nonmetal), silicon from a broken transistor (metalloid) if available, sulfur powder (nonmetal) etc. Have students observe properties – luster, malleability, conductivity (if they have a simple circuit tester), etc. Classify each as metal, nonmetal, or metalloid based on observations. If at home without pure elements, use objects: a copper wire (metal), a piece of charcoal for carbon (nonmetal), a silicon diode from electronics (metalloid) and reason out their element composition.
Build a Mini Periodic Table: Assign each student a few elements to “illustrate.” They create a card for each with its symbol, atomic number, some info (and maybe a small drawing of a use or something). Then physically arrange themselves or their cards into a big periodic table on a wall or floor. This can be a fun collaborative visualization of the table’s structure (Kreyòl labels can be encouraged: e.g., “Iron – Fe – fè” since iron in Creole is “fè”).
Group Role-play: Divide class into groups corresponding to periodic table families (one group as Alkali Metals, one as Halogens, etc.). Each group prepares a short presentation or skit about their family’s properties and a “profile” of a typical member. For example, Group 1 might say “We are Alkali Metals – we have 1 electron we really want to get rid of, so we react explosively! We form +1 ions and are soft, shiny metals.” This engages students creatively with group characteristics.
Quiz/Assessment Ideas:
Interpreting table: “Element X is in period 4 and has 6 valence electrons. Identify its group and one property.” (Period 4 means 4 shells, 6 valence means Group 16. Could be e.g. Selenium (Se). Property: likely a nonmetal/metalloid, forms -2 anions or covalent bonds, etc.). This tests understanding of group/period significance.
Multiple choice: “Which element is a noble gas? A) Nitrogen, B) Sodium, C) Neon, D) Nickel.” (C – Neon).
True/False: “All elements in the same period have similar chemical properties.” (False – that’s true for groups, not periods; period means gradual change). “Metals are located to the right side of the periodic table.” (False – metals are on the left/middle, nonmetals on right).
Matching: Create two columns, one with group names/numbers, one with descriptions. E.g., “Group 1” – “Highly reactive metals with 1 valence electron”; “Group 17” – “Reactive nonmetals that form -1 ions”; “Group 18” – “Inert gases with full valence shells”; etc. Students match group to description.
Fill-in: “The element with atomic number 12 is in Group __ and Period __. It is a (metal/nonmetal) and commonly forms a __ ion.” (Atomic #12 is Mg: Group 2, Period 3, a metal, forms +2 ion).
Short answer: “Why do elements in the same group often react in similar ways? Give an example.” (Because they have the same number of valence electrons , e.g., all halogens have 7 valence e⁻, so they all tend to gain one electron in reactions, making them similarly reactive and forming -1 ions)."
Chemistry,NSII,Unit 3: Periodic Table (Tablo Peryodik),:,"Pwopriyete Peryodik Eleman yo (Periodic Properties of Elements)
Learning Objectives:
Define key periodic properties of elements: atomic radius, ionization energy, electron affinity, electronegativity, and metallic character.
Describe and explain the general trends of these properties across a period (left to right) and down a group (top to bottom) on the periodic table  .
Use periodic trends to qualitatively compare two elements (e.g., “Which is larger, Na or Cl? Which has higher ionization energy?”) and justify the answer.
Understand how these trends relate to the underlying atomic structure (nuclear charge, number of shells, etc.).
Recognize that periodic trends are a result of the repeating patterns in electron configuration.
Key Concepts:
Atomic radius (rayon atomik): The size of an atom, often measured as half the distance between nuclei in a diatomic molecule. Trend: Atomic radius decreases across a period (atoms get smaller moving left→right) and increases down a group (atoms get larger moving top→bottom) .
Explanation: Across a period, protons are added to the nucleus (increasing nuclear charge) while electrons are added to the same shell. The stronger attraction between nucleus and electrons pulls the electron cloud in tighter, making the atom smaller. Down a group, new shells are added, so the outer electrons are farther from the nucleus (and shielded by inner electrons), resulting in a larger atomic size.
Example: A lithium (Li) atom is larger than a fluorine (F) atom even though F has more protons, because F’s greater nuclear charge pulls its electrons in more tightly. Cesium (Cs) has a much larger radius than lithium, as Cs has many more electron shells.
Ionization energy (IE, enèji ionizasyon): The energy required to remove one electron from an atom in the gaseous state (forming a cation). Trend: Ionization energy increases across a period (harder to remove electrons from the right side) and decreases down a group .
Explanation: Across a period, atoms have higher nuclear charge and smaller size, so valence electrons are held more tightly (especially for nonmetals), requiring more energy to remove. Down a group, valence electrons are farther from the nucleus and more shielded, so they are easier to remove (lower IE).
Example: It takes more energy to remove an electron from neon (Ne) than from sodium (Na), since Ne has a stable full shell (high IE), whereas Na has a single valence electron that it loses readily (lower IE). Also, potassium (K) has lower IE than lithium (Li) because K’s valence electron is in the 4th shell vs Li’s in the 2nd, so K’s electron is less tightly bound.
Electron affinity (EA, afinité elektwonik): The energy change when an atom gains an electron (often, the tendency to accept an electron). A high (more exothermic) electron affinity means the atom readily gains an electron. Trend: Generally more exothermic (higher) across a period (especially for nonmetals) and less exothermic down a group. The trend is not as smooth due to subshell arrangements, but in general, halogens have very high electron affinity (they really want an extra electron), while metals have lower or even positive EAs.
Example: Chlorine (Cl) has a high electron affinity (it releases energy gaining an electron to form Cl⁻), whereas sodium has a low EA (it doesn’t really want an extra electron). Down the halogen group, EA decreases: fluorine’s EA is high, but chlorine’s is actually higher than fluorine’s due to repulsions in F’s small 2p orbital; generally, larger atoms accommodate an extra electron more easily up to a point.
Electronegativity (elektronegativite): A measure of how strongly an atom attracts electrons in a chemical bond. Trend: Electronegativity increases across a period (nonmetals strongly attract electrons) and decreases down a group . The most electronegative element is Fluorine (EN ≈ 4.0 on Pauling scale) at top right (ignoring noble gases which aren’t typically in bonds), and the least are Cs/Fr at bottom left (around 0.7).
Explanation: Smaller atoms with high nuclear charge (like F, O, N) strongly pull bonding electrons toward themselves. Larger atoms with more shielding (like Cs, Ba) have weaker pull on electrons in bonds.
Example: In an H–F bond, fluorine is much more electronegative than hydrogen, so the bond electrons are drawn closer to F (making the bond polar). Comparing two elements: Oxygen (period 2) is more electronegative than sulfur (period 3) because O is smaller and holds electrons more tightly.
Metallic character: Describes how readily an element exhibits metallic properties (tendency to lose electrons, form cations, have luster, conduct, etc.). Trend: Metallic character decreases across a period (elements become less metallic moving to the right, turning into nonmetals) and increases down a group .
Explanation: On the left side and lower parts of the table, atoms lose electrons easily (low IE) and have larger radii, so they behave as metals. On moving right/up, atoms hold electrons more tightly (high IE, high EN), so they are nonmetallic.
Example: In Period 3: sodium (far left) is a very metallic soft metal; silicon (middle) is a metalloid; chlorine (right) is a nonmetal gas. Down Group 14: carbon (top, nonmetal), silicon (semi-metal), tin and lead (bottom, are metals). So metallic character clearly increases downward.
Other trends:
Reactivity: For metals, reactivity increases down a group (since losing electrons gets easier); for nonmetals (particularly halogens), reactivity typically decreases down a group (gaining electrons gets harder for larger atoms). Across a period, metals (left side) become less reactive moving right (toward nonmetals), while nonmetals (right side) generally become more reactive moving left to right up to Group 17, with the noble gases being inert.
Shielding effect: Inner-shell electrons shield the outer electrons from the full attraction of the nucleus. Shielding increases down a group (more inner layers), which is why outer electrons are less tightly held, affecting the above trends (bigger atoms, lower IE, etc.). Across a period, shielding is relatively constant (within the same shell), so it doesn’t counter the increasing nuclear charge – thus size decreases and IE increases across a period.
Periodic trend summary: Summarize as students often do: Across a period (→): atomic size ↓, IE ↑, EN ↑, metallic character ↓; Down a group (↓): atomic size ↑, IE ↓, EN ↓, metallic character ↑ .
Activities:
Graphing Periodic Trends: Assign students data for a period or group – e.g., atomic radii of Period 2 elements (Li to Ne) or first IE of Group 1 elements (H to Cs). Have them plot a simple graph (radius vs atomic number, etc.). They will see the trend (for period: radius goes down, for group: IE goes down). Discuss the shape of the graph and reasons. For instance, graph atomic radius for Period 3 (Na to Ar) – points should show a decreasing trend. This visual exercise reinforces trend behavior.
Trend Puzzles: Provide pairs or triads of elements and ask students to predict order by a property. For example, “Place in order of increasing atomic size: N, Be, O” (answer: O < N < Be, since across period 2 size decreases from Be to O). Or “Which has higher ionization energy, Ca or Br?” (Br, since it’s to the right of Ca). “Which is more electronegative, S or Se?” (S, above Se in Group 16). Students can work in small groups to reason out each answer using their knowledge of trends. Then review as a class.
Periodic Trend Bingo: Create bingo cards with statements or values related to periodic properties (“Smallest element in Period 3”, “Highest electronegativity”, “A very reactive metal with low IE”, “Forms a +2 ion easily”, etc.). Call out clues and have students mark if they have the element that matches. This gamifies recall of trend extremes (like knowing F is highest EN, Fr is largest atom, etc.).
Element Comparison Reports: Have students pick two elements in the same period or group and compare them in a short report or slide: they should compare atomic size, IE, EN, etc., explaining differences by position. For instance, compare carbon vs oxygen (same period) or lithium vs cesium (same group). This exercise makes them apply trend reasoning in complete sentences (could be done in Kreyòl for bilingual practice: e.g., “Lityòm gen yon gwo reyon atomik pase Li…”, mixing languages as needed for understanding).
Trend Demonstration (Optional): If possible in a lab, demonstrate a reactivity trend: e.g., drop small pieces of Mg vs Ca in water (Ca reacts more readily than Mg, showing reactivity increases down group 2). Or show that Na (period 3) reacts more vigorously than Mg (period 3) in water, illustrating that across a period metals become less reactive (because Mg’s higher IE makes it less reactive than Na). Exercise caution and proper safety if demonstrating reactive metals.
Quiz/Assessment Ideas:
Trend identification: “Does atomic radius increase or decrease from left to right across a period? Explain briefly why.” (Decrease, due to increasing nuclear charge pulling electrons closer ).
Which is larger? Provide element pairs: e.g. “Which atom is larger: Si or S?” (Si is larger; S is to its right so smaller). “K or K⁺ ion?” (K atom is larger; K⁺ has one less electron, so remaining electrons pulled in closer). “Cl or Br?” (Br is larger; it’s below Cl).
Ionization energy Qs: “Which element likely has a higher first ionization energy, Al or Cl?” (Cl, being to the right, holds electrons tighter). “Why is the IE of K lower than that of Li?” (Because K’s valence e⁻ is further from the nucleus with more shielding).
Electronegativity comparison: “Place the following in order of increasing electronegativity: O, Be, F.” (Be < O < F). “Which type of elements have the highest electronegativities?” (Nonmetals at top right, e.g., F, O, N).
Metallic vs Nonmetallic: “Among the elements in Period 4 (K through Kr), which are the most metallic and which are the least?” (Most metallic: K and Ca on far left; least: Br and Kr on far right). “True/False: Elements get more metallic as you go down a column.” (True – e.g., carbon (nonmetal) vs lead (metal) in Group 14).
Free response: “Explain why fluorine has a much higher electronegativity than lithium.” (Fluorine has 7 valence e⁻ in second shell with a strong nuclear charge of 9 protons; it strongly attracts an additional electron to complete its octet. Lithium has just 1 valence e⁻ in the second shell with 3 protons total, and it rather loses that e⁻; F is a small, high-charge atom so EN is high, Li is larger relative to its charge so EN low). Students should mention nuclear charge and size in explanation.
Data interpretation: Provide a small table of atomic radius or IE for three consecutive elements with one missing value. E.g., “Element X, Y, Z are consecutive in period 2. Radii (pm): X = 152, Y = ?, Z = 73. X is Li, Z is N. Estimate Y’s radius and identify Y.” (Between Li and N in period 2 is maybe Be, B, C – N is 73 pm, Li 152 pm, likely B or C. Actually Li (152) > Be (~112) > B (~85) > C (~70) > N (70). So Y might be Be or B – since N is 73, B around 85 pm fits. So Y could be Boron with radius ~85 pm. This is advanced, but tests understanding of decreasing trend)."
Chemistry,NSII,Unit 4: Chemical Bonding (Lyen Chimik),:,"Kalite Lyen Chimik: Iyònik kont Kowvalan (Types of Chemical Bonds: Ionic vs Covalent)
Learning Objectives:
Distinguish between ionic bonds and covalent bonds and describe how each type forms (transfer of electrons vs sharing of electrons).
Identify the kinds of elements that typically form ionic compounds (metal + nonmetal) versus covalent compounds (nonmetals with nonmetals).
Use electronegativity differences to predict bond type – large difference leads to ionic character, small difference leads to covalent .
Describe general properties of ionic compounds vs molecular (covalent) compounds (melting point, solubility, electrical conductivity, etc.).
Understand the concept of ions (cations and anions) and how ionic lattice structures form from electrostatic attraction. Recognize common ions (Na⁺, Cl⁻, Ca²⁺, SO₄²⁻, etc.).
Introduce the idea of metallic bonding (briefly) as a distinct bonding in pure metals (a sea of delocalized electrons). (Metallic bonding can be optional or brief since focus is ionic vs covalent.)
Key Concepts:
Chemical bond: An attraction between atoms that holds them together in compounds. There are different types based on how electrons are redistributed between atoms.
Ionic bond (lyen iyònik): Formed by the transfer of electrons from one atom to another, resulting in oppositely charged ions that attract each other. Typically occurs between a metal atom (which loses electrons to form a positive cation) and a nonmetal atom (which gains electrons to form a negative anion). The electrostatic attraction between cations and anions is the ionic bond.
Example: Sodium (Na) and Chlorine (Cl) form NaCl via ionic bonding. Na (metal) loses its 1 valence electron to become Na⁺, and Cl (nonmetal) gains an electron to become Cl⁻. These ions attract strongly to form a solid crystalline lattice.
Ionic compounds usually form crystal lattices – large repeating networks of ions (like each Na⁺ in NaCl is surrounded by six Cl⁻ in a cube arrangement and vice versa).
Properties of ionic compounds: High melting and boiling points (strong attractions in lattice), often soluble in water, conduct electricity when molten or dissolved (because ions are free to move), but not as solids (ions fixed in place). They tend to be hard and brittle (if the lattice is shifted, like charges repel causing fracture).
Covalent bond (lyen kowvalan): Formed by the sharing of electron pairs between atoms. Occurs usually between nonmetal atoms. The shared electrons count toward each atom’s valence, allowing each to attain a stable electron configuration (often an octet).
Example: In an H₂O molecule, oxygen shares one electron with each of two hydrogen atoms, forming two covalent O–H bonds. The sharing fulfills H’s duet (2 e⁻) and O’s octet (8 e⁻). Another example: Two chlorine atoms share a pair to form Cl₂ (each Cl gets to count 8 electrons).
Covalent bonding leads to the formation of molecules – discrete groups of atoms bonded together (like CO₂, NH₃, glucose C₆H₁₂O₆, etc.). There are also network covalent solids (e.g., diamond, SiO₂ quartz) where atoms are bonded covalently in a continuous network.
Properties of covalent (molecular) compounds: Many are gases or liquids at room temp, or low-melting solids – relatively lower melting/boiling points compared to ionic (because intermolecular forces between molecules are weaker than ionic bonds). They usually do not conduct electricity (molecules are neutral overall; no free ions or electrons, except acids in water which ionize). Many are less soluble in water unless they can hydrogen bond or react (e.g., sugar dissolves but not as ions; oil doesn’t dissolve at all because nonpolar).
Electronegativity and bond type: The difference in electronegativity (ΔEN) between bonding atoms is a guide :
Large ΔEN (typically > ~1.7) – one atom attracts electrons so much more strongly that it effectively takes an electron from the other, yielding ions → ionic bond . (E.g., ΔEN ~2.1 for Na–Cl, ionic.)
Small ΔEN (typically < ~0.4) – atoms share electrons nearly equally → nonpolar covalent bond (e.g., H–H, ΔEN 0).
Intermediate ΔEN (~0.4 to 1.7) – electrons shared unequally → polar covalent bond (with partial charges on atoms). This is actually most covalent bonds between different nonmetals. For example, H–Cl has ΔEN ~0.9, so H–Cl is a polar covalent bond (H partial +, Cl partial –). The bond is not fully ionic, but it has ionic character.
(These numeric thresholds are guidelines; real bonding is a spectrum. The key idea: metal+nonmetal → likely ionic; nonmetal+nonmetal → covalent; if unsure, use electronegativity difference.)
Examples: Classify: KBr (K metal + Br nonmetal) – ionic (K⁺, Br⁻); CO₂ (both nonmetals) – covalent (with polar bonds but overall molecule nonpolar). NH₃ (all nonmetals) – covalent (polar molecule). CaCl₂ – ionic (Ca²⁺, 2 Cl⁻). Kreyòl tip: We often name ionic compounds with the cation and anion names (e.g., “kloriòm sodyòm” could be used for sodium chloride in Creole classroom context, and “dlo” (water) is a covalent compound of H₂O).
Metallic bonding (briefly): Metals (like Cu, Fe) bond through a “sea of electrons” shared among many atoms. Metal atoms release some valence electrons which flow freely through the metal lattice. This explains why metals conduct electricity and heat (free-moving electrons), are malleable (ions can slide but remain bonded by electron sea), and lustrous (delocalized electrons can absorb/re-emit light). This is a third bonding type distinct from ionic and covalent, relevant for pure metals and alloys. (Since curriculum doesn’t emphasize in competences, we mention only briefly for completeness).
Bond strength: Generally, ionic bonds are strong due to electrostatic forces (reflected in high melting points). Covalent bond strength varies with bond order (single vs double vs triple bonds) and involved atoms but typically weaker intermolecular forces. Within molecules, covalent bonds can be very strong (like the N≡N triple bond is very strong, which is why N₂ is inert). Metallic bonds can vary in strength but often allow flexibility (hence malleability).
Activities:
Ionic vs Covalent identification lab: Provide samples of several substances (if available) and have students determine if they are likely ionic or covalent based on properties. For example: salt (NaCl) – crystalline solid, dissolves in water, solution conducts electricity (test with a simple LED conductivity tester) – properties of ionic. Sugar (sucrose) – crystalline solid, dissolves in water but solution does not conduct – indicates covalent (molecule) because no ions in solution. Distilled water vs saltwater – test conductivity (distilled water non-conductive, saltwater conductive due to ions). Wax or cooking oil – low melting, does not mix with water, does not conduct – likely covalent (nonpolar). Students record observations and classify each substance as ionic or molecular. (Safety: all substances are common kitchen items except ensure no tasting, just observation.)
Electronegativity difference exercise: Give students a chart of electronegativities (Pauling scale) for common elements. Have them calculate ΔEN for various pairs and predict bond type/polarity. E.g., ΔEN for Mg–O (~1.3, borderline but leaning ionic/polar covalent), ΔEN for C–H (~0.4, nonpolar covalent), ΔEN for H–F (~1.9, quite polar covalent, almost ionic in character). Mark each as “mostly ionic”, “polar covalent” or “nonpolar covalent”. This reinforces the concept that bond character is a spectrum .
Forming Ionic Compounds (simulation or cut-outs): Use ion cards with charges (like Na⁺, Cl⁻, Ca²⁺, O²⁻, Al³⁺, N³⁻, etc.). Have students combine the cards to form neutral compounds (like puzzle pieces). E.g., combine Ca²⁺ with two Cl⁻ to make CaCl₂, or 2 Na⁺ with S²⁻ to make Na₂S. They should write the formula and name for each combination. This helps practice the idea of charge balancing in ionic compounds and recognizing ratios.
Lewis dot for ionic vs covalent (ties with next video): Draw Lewis dot diagrams for simple ionic and covalent compounds to visualize electrons. For example, show Na● + ●●●●●●●Cl: Na gives its one dot to Cl (which had 7) resulting in [Na⁺] [Cl⁻] with Cl having full 8 dots. Versus covalent: show two F atoms each with 7 dots sharing one pair (each contributing one) to form F–F with each having 8 around. This pictorial approach (which will be expanded in Video 8) allows students to see the transfer vs sharing of electrons.
Ionic Crystal Lattice Model: If resources allow, build a 3D model of part of an ionic lattice using balls (or styrofoam) and sticks: e.g., alternate colors for Na⁺ and Cl⁻ to make a cube of NaCl structure. Even a 2D plane on paper or using a checkerboard pattern (labeled + and –) can show how ions arrange in an extended structure. By contrast, illustrate that a covalent molecule exists as a standalone entity (e.g., draw several H₂O molecules separate, noting each molecule’s bonds are internal).
Quiz/Assessment Ideas:
Definition check: “What happens to electrons in the formation of an ionic bond versus a covalent bond?” (Ionic – electrons are transferred forming ions; Covalent – electrons are shared between atoms).
Identify bond type: Provide formulas or names: “MgO – ionic or covalent?” (Ionic: metal + nonmetal). “CO₂?” (Covalent: nonmetals). “NH₄Cl?” (Contains NH₄⁺ polyatomic ion and Cl⁻, overall ionic compound). “Fe (iron metal) bonding within a piece of iron – what type?” (Metallic bonding).
Multiple choice: “Which compound has a higher melting point? A) H₂ (covalent gas) B) NaCl (ionic salt).” (B – NaCl). “Which is likely soluble in water and conducts electricity when dissolved? A) C₆H₁₂O₆ (glucose) B) KBr.” (B – KBr is ionic, dissociates into ions).
Electronegativity/Bond: “The electronegativity of H is 2.1 and of O is 3.5. The H–O bond in water is: a) nonpolar covalent, b) polar covalent, c) ionic.” (b – polar covalent, ΔEN = 1.4).
True/False: “Ionic compounds conduct electricity in solid form.” (False – only when molten or dissolved, because in solid ions can’t move). “Covalent molecules generally have lower boiling points than ionic compounds.” (True, because forces between molecules are weaker than the ionic bonds in a lattice).
Short answer: “Why do ionic compounds like NaCl form crystals rather than discrete molecules?” (Because electrostatic attraction causes ions to pack in a repeating lattice – each ion is bonded to many oppositely charged neighbors, not just one partner, leading to a continuous structure).
Properties scenario: “A substance X is found to be a liquid with low boiling point, does not conduct electricity, and is not soluble in water. What type of bonding does it likely have?” (Covalent, likely nonpolar covalent given not water-soluble).
Formula prediction: “What is the formula of the ionic compound formed between Ca²⁺ and N³⁻?” (Ca₃N₂, balancing charges). “What charge ion will an atom of chlorine form? Why?” (Cl will form Cl⁻, because it gains 1 electron to complete its valence octet)."
Chemistry,NSII,Unit 4: Chemical Bonding (Lyen Chimik),:,"Estrikti Lewis ak Lyezon Kowvalan (Lewis Structures and Covalent Bonding)
Learning Objectives:
Draw Lewis dot structures for atoms and simple covalent molecules, showing how valence electrons are shared in bonds.
Apply the octet rule (and duet rule for H) to determine how atoms share electrons in order to attain stable configurations in molecules.
Distinguish between single, double, and triple bonds in Lewis structures and understand that multiple bonds involve sharing more than one pair of electrons.
Represent coordinate covalent bonds (if relevant, but may be beyond NS II scope – likely skip unless teacher introduces for completeness) – skip if not needed.
Use Lewis structures to predict molecular formulas of simple compounds given the constituent atoms (e.g., deduce that carbon (4 valence) with hydrogens (1 valence) will likely form CH₄ to give C eight electrons and each H two).
Introduce the concept of oxidation numbers of atoms in covalent compounds and how to assign them (since competence asks to specify oxidation numbers) . Determine oxidation states for elements in simple molecules (e.g. in CO₂, carbon is +4, oxygen -2 each).
Lay the groundwork for molecular geometry (to be expanded in next video) by showing how Lewis structures indicate bonding pairs and lone pairs of electrons.
Key Concepts:
Lewis dot symbols for atoms: A notation where the element symbol is surrounded by dots representing its valence electrons. For example, Oxygen (6 valence e⁻) is shown as O with 6 dots around it (two paired on three sides). Nitrogen (5 valence) is N with 5 dots (two paired and one single). This helps visualize how many electrons are unpaired (available for bonding).
Octet rule: Most main-group atoms strive to have 8 electrons in their valence shell (like a noble gas) through bonding. Hydrogen is an exception – it aims for 2 (a duet, like He). Lewis structures show how atoms share electrons to achieve octets/duets.
Lewis structures for molecules: We represent covalent bonds as shared pairs of dots (or a line) between two atomic symbols. Lone (nonbonding) pairs are dots not involved in bonding on a single atom.
Example: Cl₂: Each Cl atom has 7 valence electrons (●●●●●●●). They share one pair to each get 8. Lewis: Cl–Cl with each Cl also having 6 lone-pair dots around it (so each has 8 total).
H₂O: Oxygen (6 valence) will form 2 bonds (needs 2 more electrons for octet) with two H atoms (each H needs 1 for duet). Lewis: O in center with two O–H single bonds, and O has two lone pairs left. Each H has its duet via the bond, O has 8 total (4 from two lone pairs + 2 from two bonds).
CH₄ (methane): Carbon (4 valence) needs 4 more for octet, so it forms 4 single bonds with 4 hydrogens (each H shares 1 to get duet). Lewis: C in middle with 4 single lines to H’s (no lone pairs on C, each bond counts as 2 electrons for C giving it 8).
O₂: Each O (6 valence) needs 2 electrons, so they form a double bond (sharing 2 pairs). Lewis: O=O with each O also having 2 lone pairs. Each O now sees 4 electrons from the double bond + 4 from lone pairs = 8.
N₂: Each N (5 valence) needs 3, so form a triple bond between the two N atoms. Lewis: N≡N with each N having one lone pair remaining. Each N then has 6 from the triple bond + 2 from lone pair = 8. This triple bond is very strong (making N₂ very stable/inert).
Single, double, triple bonds: Represented by one, two, three lines respectively in Lewis structures (or pairs of dots). They indicate sharing of 1, 2, 3 electron pairs respectively. More shared pairs = stronger bond and shorter bond length. Example: compare single bond in F–F vs double bond in O=O vs triple in N≡N.
Polyatomic molecules: For slightly more complex molecules (if in curriculum scope) like CO₂: Carbon (4 valence) forms two double bonds with two oxygens (each O provides 2 electrons to share). Lewis: O=C=O with each O having two lone pairs. Or NH₃ (ammonia): N (5 valence) forms 3 single bonds to H and has 1 lone pair left.
Resonance (mention if needed): Some molecules/ions can have multiple valid Lewis structures (e.g., SO₂, ozone O₃, carbonate ion CO₃²⁻) – actual structure is a resonance hybrid. This might be beyond NS II minimal competences, so could skip or briefly mention with sulfate or nitrate if those polyatomic ions come up. Perhaps skip for simplicity unless teacher input.
Lewis for ions: We also can draw Lewis structures for polyatomic ions by adding or removing electrons for the charge, and enclosing structure in brackets with charge. Example: Ammonium NH₄⁺ (5+4 valence minus 1 electron for + charge) has 8 e⁻ total, forming four N–H bonds no lone pairs on N. Hydroxide OH⁻ (O has 6 + H 1 + 1 extra for – charge = 8 e⁻) is drawn as O–H with O having 3 lone pairs and bracketed with “⁻”.
VSEPR tie-in: The Lewis structure gives a count of bonding pairs vs lone pairs, which is the basis to predict shape (coming in next video). For example, in NH₃ Lewis we see 3 bonding pairs, 1 lone pair on N – which will correspond to a trigonal pyramidal shape. Students will use these later.
Oxidation numbers in covalent compounds: Oxidation number (oxydasyon nonm) is a bookkeeping charge assigned under the assumption that the more electronegative atom in each bond takes the electrons. General rules: Free element = 0; F is always -1 in compounds; O is usually -2 (except in peroxides -1, or with F); H is +1 with nonmetals (like in H₂O, H is +1) and -1 with metals; sum of oxidation numbers = overall charge of molecule/ion  .
Example: In H₂O, assign H +1 (with O more electronegative, it “claims” the electrons). There are two H, so total +2 from H. The molecule is neutral, so O must be -2 to balance +2. Indeed, oxygen often is -2 in compounds.
CO₂: O is more electronegative, assign each O as -2. Two O’s contribute -4. To make the sum zero (neutral CO₂), carbon must be +4. So oxidation states: C +4, O -2 each.
NH₃: N more electronegative than H? Actually N is 3.0, H 2.1, so H is less EN, assign H +1 each. 3 H gives +3, so N is -3 to balance (makes sense: N has oxidation -3 in ammonia).
These oxidation numbers reflect electron distribution in a hypothetical fully ionic separation. They are useful for identifying redox changes (next unit) and in nomenclature of certain compounds. In a Lewis sense, oxidation number is calculated by assuming bonding electrons go to the more electronegative atom.
Formal charge (maybe beyond scope): Possibly skip formal charges unless needed for choosing best Lewis structure (likely not needed for NS II minimal). Oxidation number and formal charge are different concepts (formal charge assumes equal sharing, oxidation assumes ionic division). Probably skip detail to avoid confusion.
Lewis structure strategy: (May outline steps for students: count total valence electrons, choose central atom (often least EN or singular atom), arrange symmetrically, bond atoms (2 e⁻ each bond), distribute remaining electrons as lone pairs to satisfy octets (outer atoms first, then central if any left), form multiple bonds if central lacks octet, check count and adjust). Students can practice simple ones with guidance.
Activities:
Lewis Dot Practice: Start with single atoms: have students draw Lewis dot symbols for various elements (C, Cl, K, O, N, etc.) to ensure they can depict valence electrons correctly.
Bond Formation with Dots: Pair up students each with a different atom’s dot diagram (e.g., one student “Chlorine” with 7 dots, another “Chlorine” with 7 dots). Let them bring their sheets together so that each Cl can share one dot with the other, making a pair (they can circle the shared pair). This shows Cl₂ formation. Similarly, do H (1 dot) plus F (7 dots) sharing to form HF, etc. This interactive pairing can be done on paper or using cut-out “electron” stickers.
Lewis Structure Worksheet: Provide a list of molecules for students to draw Lewis structures: e.g., H₂, O₂, N₂, F₂, HCl, H₂O, NH₃, CH₄, CO₂, CCl₄, etc. Have them show all lone pairs and bonds. Then check answers together. Emphasize satisfying octets/duets and correct total electron counts. (This can be done by having them count total valence electrons to ensure they distribute correctly.)
Molecule Construction Kit (optional): If available, use a ball-and-stick model kit to build molecules after drawing Lewis structures. E.g., build NH₃ model: one atom with 3 single bonds to H. Students can see 3D shape too. If no kit, they can make simple models with marshmallows (atoms) and toothpicks (bonds) for CH₄, H₂O, CO₂, etc., corresponding to their Lewis structures (with toothpicks representing shared pairs – double bond could be two toothpicks between same atoms if they try O₂ perhaps). This bridges into next video’s geometry.
Oxidation Number Assignment: Once a few Lewis structures are drawn, have students assign oxidation numbers for each atom. For example, for H₂O (drawn as H–O–H with lone pairs on O), ask: assign oxidation states (H +1 each, O -2). For CO₂ (O=C=O), assign (O -2 each, C +4). For NH₄⁺ (which they might have seen as polyatomic ion example), assign (H +1 each, so +4 total, N then must be -3? Actually NH₄⁺ sum +1, 4 H = +4, so N = -3 to make +1 overall). This can be a short exercise separate from Lewis drawing – essentially use electronegativity rule: more EN gets negative. (This double-checks understanding of electronegativity too.)
Quiz/Assessment Ideas:
Dot structure basics: “Draw the Lewis dot symbol for each of the following atoms: Mg, S, Br, Ar.” (Mg: two dots, S: six dots, Br: seven, Ar: eight (full octet)).
Lewis structure drawing: Provide a simple molecule formula and ask for Lewis structure. E.g., “Sketch the Lewis structure for SiH₄” (silicon has 4 valence, bonds to 4 H, similar to CH₄). Or “for OCl₂” (oxygen in center with 2 bonds to Cl, two lone pairs on O, each Cl with 3 lone pairs). Check that students depict lone pairs and bonding pairs correctly.
Octet rule check: “In the Lewis structure of NF₃, how many lone pairs are on the central N? Does each F have an octet?” (N has one lone pair, each F has 3 lone pairs and one bonding pair, yes each F has 8 electrons around it, N has 8 too).
Bond type count: “How many bonding pairs and lone pairs are in the Lewis structure of water (H₂O)?” (2 bonding pairs, 2 lone pairs on O). “How many total electrons are shared in a double bond?” (4 electrons, since 2 pairs).
Resonance (if taught): Possibly ask: “The carbonate ion CO₃²⁻ can be drawn with one C=O double bond and two C–O single bonds. Yet all C–O bonds are identical experimentally. What concept explains this?” (Resonance – the actual structure is an average of three resonance forms). (This is advanced but if resonance was introduced, a question like this could test it).
Oxidation number application: “Assign oxidation numbers to each atom in the following: H₂S (H +1 each, S -2), NO₂ (assume O -2 each, total O -4, so N +4), CF₄ (F -1 each, so C +4).” Or ask conceptual: “In CO, carbon monoxide, oxygen is assigned -2. What is carbon’s oxidation state?” (Carbon would be +2 to balance the 0 overall).
True/False: “In a Lewis structure, each line represents two electrons shared between atoms.” (True – a bonding pair). “The octet rule is satisfied for all elements in any stable compound.” (False – exceptions exist: e.g., H wants 2, B often 6, expanded octets for P, S sometimes, etc. But maybe not emphasize exceptions in NS II).
Exception awareness (for advanced students): “Which of these is an exception to the octet rule? A) CH₄, B) NH₃, C) BF₃, D) H₂O.” (C – BF₃, boron has only 6 electrons in typical Lewis structure). If not covered, skip such a question.
Short answer: “Explain why N₂ has a triple bond according to Lewis structure and why that bond is particularly strong.” (Each N needs 3 electrons to complete octet, so they share 3 pairs; triple bonds are stronger because more electrons bind the atoms closely together)."
Chemistry,NSII,Unit 4: Chemical Bonding (Lyen Chimik),:,"Fòm Jeyometrik ak Polarite Molekil (Molecular Geometry and Polarity)
Learning Objectives:
Use VSEPR theory (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) to predict the 3D geometry of simple covalent molecules based on their Lewis structures (counting bonding pairs vs lone pairs on the central atom).
Identify common molecular shapes: linear, trigonal planar, tetrahedral, trigonal pyramidal, bent (V-shaped), etc., and associate them with their approximate bond angles. (Use Creole terms alongside: e.g., “fòm lineyè”, “plàn trigonal”, “tetrahèdral”, “piramid trigonal”, “ang bent”).
Determine whether a molecule is polar or nonpolar overall, based on both bond polarity and molecular shape (symmetry). Explain that a molecule with polar bonds can be nonpolar if the geometry causes dipoles to cancel out .
Describe the concept of dipole moment: polar molecules have an asymmetrical charge distribution (one end δ⁺, other δ⁻), while nonpolar molecules have a symmetric distribution.
Provide examples of polar vs nonpolar molecules and relate polarity to properties like solubility (polar dissolves polar, etc.) and intermolecular forces (if introduced, e.g., mention hydrogen bonding requires polar bonds).
Recognize intermolecular forces qualitatively (without deep detail): e.g., polar molecules attract each other via dipole-dipole forces, hydrogen bonds (especially in H₂O, NH₃) cause higher boiling points, whereas nonpolar molecules rely on weaker London dispersion forces. (This objective can be optional if not enough time, but likely a brief mention since interactions are in curriculum content as “entèraksyon molekilè” ).
Key Concepts:
VSEPR theory: Electron pairs (bonding or lone) around a central atom repel each other and will arrange themselves as far apart as possible in 3D space. This determines molecular geometry. The geometry is described by the positions of the atoms (not the lone pairs, which are invisible but affect shape).
Electron pair geometry vs molecular shape:
Electron pair geometry considers all electron regions (bonding + lone pairs).
Molecular geometry considers only the arrangement of atoms (the visible shape). Lone pairs influence shape but are not “seen” as points in the shape.
Common geometries:
Linear (lineyè): 2 electron regions around central atom. Bond angle 180°. Example: CO₂ (O=C=O) – no lone pairs on C, 2 double-bond regions → linear shape . Also, BeCl₂ (if considering, linear). Molecule shape linear = atoms in a straight line.
Trigonal planar (plàn trigonal): 3 electron regions, all bonding, spread 120° apart in a plane. Example: BF₃ (boron trifluoride) – B has 3 bonds, no lone pairs → trigonal planar. Also formaldehyde H₂CO (with double bond as one region) approximates trigonal planar at carbon.
Tetrahedral (tetrahèdral): 4 electron regions, all bonding, arrange in 3D with ~109.5° angles. Example: CH₄ (methane) – Carbon with 4 bonds forms a tetrahedron (imagine a pyramid with triangular base). All H atoms are equivalently spaced in 3D.
Trigonal pyramidal (piramid trigonal): 4 regions total, but 3 bonding + 1 lone pair. The electron geometry is tetrahedral, but the molecular shape (atoms) is a trigonal pyramid (the lone pair sits as “peak” of pyramid). Bond angles slightly <109.5° (~107° for NH₃). Example: NH₃ (ammonia) – N has 3 bonds and one lone pair, shape is a three-sided pyramid with N at apex and H’s forming base triangle.
Bent (Anglé / “V-shape”): This occurs in two cases:
3 regions total: 2 bonding + 1 lone pair (from trigonal planar electron geometry). Example: SO₂ (sulfur dioxide) – shape is bent (around ~119°).
4 regions total: 2 bonding + 2 lone pairs (from tetrahedral electron geometry). Example: H₂O – oxygen has 2 bonds, 2 lone pairs; the shape is bent (nonlinear) with angle ~104.5°. Thus water is a bent molecule.
(If needed, mention 5 (trigonal bipyramidal, e.g., PCl₅) and 6 regions (octahedral, e.g., SF₆) for completeness, but NS II may not go that far since those involve expanded octets beyond basic scope. Likely skip or briefly acknowledge such exist if a question arises, focusing on common shapes for up to 4 regions.)
Molecular polarity: A molecule is polar if it has an uneven distribution of electron density – i.e., one end of the molecule is partially negative (δ⁻) and the opposite end is partially positive (δ⁺). A molecule is nonpolar if its overall charge distribution is symmetric, so any bond dipoles cancel out.
Factors:
Bond polarity: determined by electronegativity differences. E.g., an H–Cl bond is polar (Cl δ⁻, H δ⁺). C–H is only weakly polar (almost nonpolar).
Shape symmetry: if polar bonds are arranged symmetrically, their dipoles can cancel. If arranged asymmetrically, the molecule will have a net dipole.
Examples of polar vs nonpolar:
Nonpolar molecules:
Diatomic molecules of same element (H₂, O₂, Cl₂) – identical atoms share electrons equally, no polarity.
Symmetric molecules with identical outer atoms: CO₂ (O=C=O) is linear with two equal polar C=O bonds in opposite directions, they cancel → CO₂ is nonpolar overall (despite C=O bonds being polar). CF₄ (tetrahedral with 4 identical C–F polar bonds symmetrically arranged) is nonpolar overall, as each bond’s dipole cancels with the symmetrical others. Boron trifluoride BF₃ (trigonal planar, symmetric 120°) is nonpolar (dipoles cancel at center).
Polar molecules:
H₂O (water): Bent shape means the two O–H bond dipoles do not cancel – oxygen end is δ⁻ and hydrogen end δ⁺, making water a strongly polar molecule .
NH₃ (ammonia): Trigonal pyramidal shape – the three N–H bonds don’t cancel perfectly because of the lone pair asymmetry; N end is δ⁻, H end δ⁺, so ammonia is polar.
HCl: Only two atoms, bond is polar, so molecule is polar (one end δ⁻, one δ⁺).
CH₃Cl (chloromethane): Tetrahedral but not symmetrical (three H and one Cl around C). The C–Cl bond is polar and the molecule isn’t symmetric (Cl is different from H’s), so it’s polar (with Cl end δ⁻).
Polarity effects: Polar molecules attract each other (dipole-dipole forces, hydrogen bonding if H with N/O/F). This leads to higher boiling points and solubility in polar solvents (e.g., water). Nonpolar molecules have only weak dispersion forces, hence lower boiling points and they mix well with other nonpolars (like oils mix with oils, not with water). The rule “Like dissolves like” – polar substances dissolve in polar solvents, nonpolar in nonpolar – stems from molecular polarity. For example, salt (ionic, effectively very polar) dissolves in water (polar), but oil (nonpolar) does not. Water is sometimes called a “polar solvent” in Creole “solvan polè” and oil a “solvan ki pa polè”.
Intermolecular interactions (Entèraksyon ant molekil):
Dipole-dipole forces: Attractive forces between positive end of one polar molecule and negative end of another. Stronger polarity = stronger force. E.g., between HCl molecules.
Hydrogen bonding (Lyezon idwojèn): A special, strong dipole interaction when H is bonded to a very electronegative atom (N, O, or F). The H becomes δ⁺ and is strongly attracted to lone pairs on neighboring N/O/F. E.g., between water molecules (O–H…O hydrogen bonds) or NH₃ (N–H…N). These raise boiling points greatly (water is liquid at room temp due to H-bonds, whereas H₂S is gas with no H-bonding).
London dispersion forces: Weak attractions due to momentary dipoles in all molecules, significant in nonpolar ones or heavier atoms. E.g., Br₂ is liquid and I₂ solid at room temp largely due to dispersion (heavier, more electrons = stronger dispersion). This explains why even nonpolar substances can condense if cooled.
Understanding of these can remain qualitative – just know that polar molecules have stronger attractions than nonpolar, and hydrogen bonding is especially strong (relevant to water’s unique properties).
Activities:
Molecular Model Shapes: Using ball-and-stick model kits or homemade modeling (marshmallows/clay and toothpicks), have students build models of molecules from Video 8’s Lewis structures: CH₄ (tetrahedral), NH₃ (trigonal pyramidal with an “invisible” lone pair – instruct them to imagine one corner of tetrahedron is a lone pair), H₂O (bent), CO₂ (linear), BF₃ (trigonal planar), etc. Have them draw or observe the shape. If kits have different colors for atoms, emphasize symmetry vs asymmetry. E.g., build CCl₄ vs CHCl₃ – note that CCl₄ is symmetric, CHCl₃ is not (leading to polarity differences).
Molecular Geometry Chart: Create a chart listing the number of bonding pairs and lone pairs and the resulting shape and angle. For example:
Have students fill this table as an exercise or reference. Then quiz them: “If a molecule has 4 regions and 1 lone pair, what shape?” (Trigonal pyramidal). Use their Lewis structure knowledge to determine “regions” on a given central atom, then identify shape.
Polarity Inquiry with models: Once shapes are built or drawn, ask: Which of these models are symmetric? For symmetric ones (like CO₂, CCl₄, BF₃), discuss if the molecule would have a dipole moment (no, they cancel – nonpolar). For asymmetric ones (H₂O bent, NH₃ pyramidal, CH₃Cl tetra but with different atoms), discuss dipole direction. You can use arrows to indicate bond dipoles on drawings, then vector-add them. Alternatively, use the analogy of “tug-of-war” in molecule: if pulls cancel, no net polarity; if one side pulls more, polar. For example, H₂O: O pulls electrons from both H and since bent, those pulls don’t directly oppose – they add up to a net pull toward O, so polar. CO₂: O’s pull from each side directly oppose each other linearly, cancel out, so nonpolar.
Polarity and Solubility Demo:
Take water (polar) and cooking oil (nonpolar). Show they don’t mix (two layers) – “like dissolves like” demonstration. Then add a few drops of food coloring (which is water-based, polar) – it will mix into water layer but not go into oil layer. Add a pinch of salt (ionic, extremely polar) – it dissolves in the water layer, not in oil. Conversely, take a small amount of iodine (if available; iodine dissolves in nonpolar solvents giving a purple color) – iodine doesn’t dissolve well in water but does in oil (turns it purple). Or simpler, add a bit of sugar vs a bit of wax to water: sugar (polar-ish) dissolves, wax (nonpolar) does not. These qualitative observations tie polarity to solubility. Have students explain using molecule polarity: water (polar) attracts charged or polar solutes; oil (nonpolar) only dissolves nonpolar solutes.
Another fun quick demo: charge a plastic comb or balloon by rubbing on hair (adds static charge). Bring it near a thin stream of water from a faucet – the water stream bends toward the comb because polar water molecules reorient and are attracted to the charged object. Try the same with a stream of a nonpolar liquid (like very thin stream of hexane, if lab safe to do – likely not at home, so just mention conceptually). Students can try the comb and water trick at home – it’s a classic demonstration of water’s polarity in action (H₂O dipoles align toward charged comb)【reference common knowledge】.
Intermolecular Forces Demo: If possible, demonstrate different boiling points: e.g., acetone (polar but no hydrogen bonding, BP ~56°C) vs water (polar + hydrogen bonds, BP 100°C) – acetone evaporates quickly from skin (feels cold) whereas water not as fast. Or compare evaporation rates of equal drops of water vs rubbing alcohol vs nail polish remover on a surface to infer relative strengths of intermolecular forces (water H-bonding slows evaporation). Another is surface tension: water (high due to H-bonds) forms beads on wax, supports a paper clip carefully placed; alcohol (lower surface tension) doesn’t bead as strongly. These phenomena illustrate strong vs weaker intermolecular forces. Discuss how water’s polarity and hydrogen bonding lead to its unique properties like high boiling point, high surface tension.
Dipole Moment Arrows: Have students practice drawing a polar molecule and marking the dipole moment direction (arrow pointing from positive to negative end, often drawn with a cross on positive end like |–>). For example, draw H₂O bent, then draw an arrow pointing from between the H’s toward the O (showing net dipole toward O). Do same for NH₃ (arrow from base of pyramid toward N apex). For CO₂, show that arrows from C to each O cancel (point in opposite directions), resulting in no net arrow. Visualizing these helps cement understanding of polarity vector addition.
Quiz/Assessment Ideas:
Shape identification: Provide Lewis structures or descriptions of bonding and ask for the shape. E.g., “What is the molecular geometry of PH₃?” (P has 5 valence, 3 bonds to H, 1 lone pair → trigonal pyramidal). “Shape of CO₂?” (2 bonds, 0 lone pairs on C → linear). “Shape of SF₂ (sulfur difluoride)?” (S has 6 valence, likely 2 bonds to F, 2 lone pairs → bent).
Bond angle concept: “Which has a larger bond angle, H₂O or H₂S?” (Both bent, but H₂O ~104.5°, H₂S a bit larger maybe ~108° because S’s lone pairs repel less strongly? Actually H₂S angle ~92°, oh, because S is larger – might not expect them to know that nuance. Instead ask: “Arrange bond angles: CH₄ (109.5), NH₃ (~107), H₂O (~104.5)” – presumably CH₄ > NH₃ > H₂O because lone pairs compress angles). Or conceptual: “Why is the H–O–H angle in water less than the H–C–H angle in methane?” (Because two lone pairs on O repel the bonding pairs, squeezing bonds closer).
Polarity questions: “Is CCl₄ polar or nonpolar? Why?” (Nonpolar, symmetric tetrahedral – the dipoles cancel). “Is CHCl₃ (chloroform) polar?” (Yes, asymmetrical tetrahedral – the three C–H vs one C–Cl create a net dipole). “Which molecule is polar: CO₂ or SO₂?” (CO₂ is linear nonpolar; SO₂ is bent polar).
Dipole concept: “HBr is a polar molecule. Label the δ⁺ and δ⁻ ends.” (H δ⁺, Br δ⁻ since Br more EN). “In NF₃, where does the dipole moment point (toward N or F)? And is NF₃ polar?” (N EN 3.0, F 4.0, so each N–F bond is polar toward F; shape is trig pyramidal, not symmetric, so yes polar, with net dipole toward the three F side or basically toward F atoms collectively).
Intermolecular forces: “What special intermolecular force exists between water molecules that gives water a high boiling point?” (Hydrogen bonding). “Why does I₂ (solid iodine) have a higher boiling point than F₂ (gas) even though both are nonpolar?” (I₂ has more electrons, stronger London dispersion forces). If not taught deeply, could skip such details.
Application: “Water is a polar solvent. Which of the following will likely dissolve in water? A) NaCl, B) oil, C) sugar, D) CO₂.” (NaCl – yes, dissociates into ions; sugar – yes, has polar -OH groups making it water-soluble; oil – no, nonpolar; CO₂ – slightly in water due to reaction forming carbonic acid, but generally not very soluble because nonpolar linear molecule).
True/False: “A molecule with polar bonds can be nonpolar overall.” (True, if symmetric geometry cancels out dipoles). “All bent molecules are polar.” (Usually true if two different atoms, like H₂O, SO₂ are polar, but if both outer atoms same and central has lone pairs, yes typically polar because symmetry is broken. So true in general context). “Polar molecules have higher boiling points than nonpolar molecules of similar size.” (True, due to stronger dipole attractions).
Short answer: “Explain why ammonia (NH₃) is a polar molecule but boron trifluoride (BF₃) is not, even though both have polar bonds.” (NH₃ has a trigonal pyramidal shape – the three N–H bond dipoles do not cancel, giving a net dipole toward the lone pair side of N. BF₃ is trigonal planar and symmetric – the three B–F bond dipoles cancel out, resulting in no overall dipole moment ). Students should mention shape/symmetry differences.
Hydrogen bonding Q: “Which molecule can form hydrogen bonds with others of its kind: CH₃OH (methanol) or CH₃SH (thiomethanol)?” (CH₃OH can – the O–H group can H-bond; CH₃SH cannot H-bond effectively because S is much less electronegative, not enough dipole). This tests recognition of N/O/F–H bonds needed for H-bonding."
Chemistry,NSII,Unit 5: Solutions and Mixtures (Solisyon ak Melanj),:,"Substans Pi ak Melanj (Pure Substances and Mixtures – Purity and Properties)
Learning Objectives:
Define and distinguish between a pure substance (substans pi) and a mixture (melanj). Recognize that pure substances have fixed composition and properties, while mixtures contain two or more substances physically combined.
Understand that pure substances can be elements or compounds, and mixtures can be homogeneous (solution) or heterogeneous.
Explain how physical properties like melting point and boiling point can be used to assess the purity of a substance . Understand that pure substances have characteristic sharp m.p./b.p., whereas mixtures may have broad ranges or different m.p./b.p. than pure components.
Describe basic methods of separating mixtures (filtration, distillation, etc.) by exploiting differences in physical properties (though details of methods may be minimal in NS II; just concept that mixtures can be separated physically).
Identify everyday examples of pure substances vs mixtures.
Recognize the terms solution, solute, solvent as a special case of homogeneous mixture (to be further explored in next video).
Introduce idea that impurities affect melting/boiling points (e.g., salt lowers freezing point of water, raises boiling point) – thus checking these properties can indicate if a sample is pure or not.
Key Concepts:
Pure substance: Matter that has a constant composition and uniform properties throughout. It contains only one type of element or one type of compound. All samples of a pure substance have the same chemical makeup and physical properties (under given conditions).
Examples: Pure water (H₂O) is a compound and is the same everywhere (11.1% H, 88.9% O by mass). Pure sodium chloride, pure iron metal, pure gold (element Au), pure ethanol (compound C₂H₅OH), etc. If it’s listed on the periodic table (element) or has a fixed formula (compound), it is pure.
Element vs Compound: An element consists of one type of atom (e.g., helium gas is just He atoms, aluminum foil is Al atoms). A compound consists of two or more types of atoms chemically bonded in a fixed ratio (e.g., NaCl always 1:1 Na to Cl, CO₂ always 1 C to 2 O).
Mixture (Melanj): A combination of two or more substances that are not chemically bonded – they are just physically intermingled. Composition can vary and each component retains its own properties. Mixtures can be separated by physical means (filtration, evaporation, etc.) since no new substances are formed.
Homogeneous mixture (sousans/solisyon): Uniform composition throughout – also called a solution. The different components are mixed at the molecular level and you cannot distinguish them by eye. Examples: Salt water (salt + water forms one uniform phase), air (mixture of gases like N₂, O₂, etc.), brass (solid solution of copper and zinc). The properties are the same throughout the sample.
Heterogeneous mixture: Non-uniform composition; different parts (phases) of the mixture are visible or have different properties. Examples: Sand and iron filings (you can see different grains), oil and water (two liquid layers), granite rock (you can see different mineral grains), a salad (various ingredients not uniform).
Properties and identification:
Melting point (MP) and Boiling point (BP): Pure substances have specific melting and boiling temperatures at given pressure. For instance, pure water boils at 100°C (at 1 atm) and freezes at 0°C sharply. A pure crystalline solid often melts at a sharp temperature. Impurities or mixtures cause melting point depression or boiling point elevation and a range . For example, saltwater doesn’t have a single freezing point – it freezes below 0°C and over a range depending on concentration. A mixture of two solids (e.g., two metals) may melt over a range, not sharply at one temp.
So, measuring MP/BP can test purity: If a sample of water boils at 102°C, it likely contains impurities (like dissolved minerals raising BP). If a supposed “pure” compound melts at a lower temperature than literature and over a span, it’s probably not pure. In the lab, checking melting point range is a classic test of organic compound purity .
Other properties: Density, refractive index, etc. are also fixed for pure substances at given conditions and can be used for identification. Mixtures’ properties are weighted averages (e.g., adding salt increases water’s density).
Effects of impurities:
Adding a solute to a solvent lowers the solvent’s freezing point and raises its boiling point (colligative properties). Example: Salt in water – pure water FP 0°C, but seawater might freeze around -2°C because salt disrupts ice formation. Boiling: pure water BP 100°C, salted water might boil slightly above 100°C .
This is why we put antifreeze (ethylene glycol solution) in car radiators – it lowers water’s freezing point and raises boiling point, preventing freezing in winter and boil-overs in summer. Also why adding salt on ice causes ice to melt (lowers freezing point so ice can’t stay solid at 0°C).
Separation of mixtures: Since components of mixtures are not bonded, we can separate them by physical means:
Filtration: Separate an insoluble solid from a liquid (e.g., sand from water). The liquid passes through filter paper, solid stays.
Evaporation/Crystallization: Remove a liquid to recover dissolved solid (e.g., evaporate water from saltwater to get salt crystals).
Distillation: Separate liquids by boiling off the more volatile component first and re-condensing it. Useful for homogeneous liquid mixtures (like alcohol-water, gasoline components). Each substance boils at its own temperature.
Magnetism: Use a magnet to pick out magnetic materials (like separating iron filings from a mixture with sulfur powder).
Decanting/Separatory funnel: Separate immiscible liquids (like oil and water) by letting them settle and then pouring off one layer.
(Details of processes can be minimal; goal is understanding mixtures can be separated without chemical reactions, unlike compounds which require chemical means to separate into elements).
Examples in everyday context:
Pure substance: Distilled water (ideally just H₂O). Mixture: Tap water (contains minerals, chlorine, etc.).
Pure substance: 24k gold jewelry (pure Au). Mixture: 18k gold jewelry (alloy of Au with other metals like copper – a homogeneous metallic mixture).
Pure substance: Oxygen gas cylinder (just O₂). Mixture: Air (a homogeneous mixture of ~78% N₂, 21% O₂, etc.).
Pure compound: Table sugar (sucrose, C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁, uniform). Mixture: Syrup (sugar + water solution, plus maybe flavor, etc.).
Heterogeneous mix: Pizza (you can pick out components). Homogeneous mix: Milk (if fresh homogenized milk – though under microscope it’s tiny fat globules in water, but macroscopically uniform).
Activities:
Classify Samples: Show or list various materials and ask students to classify as pure element, pure compound, homogeneous mixture, or heterogeneous mixture. Examples:
NaCl salt (table salt) – pure compound (if no additives).
Steel (iron with carbon etc.) – homogeneous mixture (alloy).
Blood – heterogeneous mixture (cells, plasma, etc.).
Vinegar – homogeneous mixture (acetic acid in water solution).
Dirt – heterogeneous mixture (varied composition).
Baking soda (NaHCO₃) – pure compound.
Bronze (Cu/Sn alloy) – homogeneous mixture.
Granite – heterogeneous (different minerals visible).
This can be a quick interactive game or listing on board.
Melting point test (teacher demo if possible): If lab resources allow: Show that a pure solid (like pure benzoic acid or another known substance) has a sharp melt in a capillary tube (melts at e.g. 122°C). Mix in a bit of impurity and show it melts at a slightly lower temp and over a broader range. Or simpler: two types of chocolate – pure cocoa butter vs mixed candy? Eh not as clear. Alternatively, measure boiling point of distilled vs salt water (though difference might be a degree or two, which requires a good thermometer). A simpler dramatic one: freeze pure water vs salt water – pure water freezes at 0°C in an ice bath, salt water remains liquid below 0°C. Perhaps have students observe ice cubes made from fresh water vs salt water (the saltwater one might melt faster on counter due to depressed freezing point – not super clear though).
Purity and melting ice experiment: A known quick demo: Take two identical ice cubes; sprinkle salt on one. The salted ice cube will melt faster (because salt lowers melting point, effectively the ice + salt mixture can melt at a lower temp, so at room temp it melts more readily than pure ice). Students can do this at home: put one teaspoon of salt on an ice cube and observe compared to a plain ice cube – salted one should start melting and feel colder (because it’s essentially an endothermic dissolution process). This shows impurity (salt) affecting freezing point.
Boiling point elevation (conceptual or demo): If safe, boil a small amount of distilled water in a flask with thermometer – show it boils at ~100°C (depending on calibration and pressure). Then add a bunch of salt, stir, see if boiling temp goes up slightly. Alternatively, just discuss why adding salt to cooking water slightly raises boiling point (and thus might cook food slightly hotter – although the effect is small at normal concentrations).
Identifying Unknown by MP/BP (thought experiment): Provide students with data: e.g., an unknown substance melts at 801°C and dissolves in water – likely table salt (NaCl melts ~801°C). Another unknown boils at 100°C and freezes at 0°C – likely pure water. If it boiled at 102°C, perhaps it’s impure water or water with something dissolved. This exercise shows how these constants can hint at identity/purity.
Separating Mixtures Project: If possible as a lab or thought exercise: Give a “mixture” and ask how to separate it into components. For instance: a mixture of sand, salt, and iron filings. Students propose: use magnet to remove iron (filings stick to magnet), then add water to dissolve salt, filter to separate sand (sand stays on filter, salt solution passes), finally evaporate water to get salt. This touches various separation techniques. If done as an actual lab, it’s classic and fun – they can measure masses before and after to see recovery. If not physically, talk through the steps logically.
Household pure vs mixture scavenger: Have students list 5 items at home and identify if pure substance or mixture. E.g., copper wire (pure element), baking soda (pure compound), table sugar (pure compound, though if it’s commercial sugar maybe a pure compound essentially), coffee (mixture – solution of various compounds in water), milk (mixture, homogeneous colloid), salad dressing (heterogeneous mixture). Discuss findings.
Melting point lookup game: Provide a list of melting points and ask which are likely pure substances vs mixtures. For instance: If something has a precise melting point given to 0.1°C, likely a pure compound. If something softens over a range (like chocolate softens over ~30-34°C, chocolate is a mixture of fats and solids). Candle wax melts over a range ~50-60°C because it’s a mix of hydrocarbons. This can be more advanced but relates to purity.
Quiz/Assessment Ideas:
Definitions: “Define a pure substance and give two examples.” “What is a homogeneous mixture? Give an example.” (E.g., pure substance: “A material with uniform composition that cannot be separated by physical means – e.g., distilled water, sulfur, sodium chloride.” Homog. mixture: “Uniform combination of substances – e.g., brass alloy, air, vinegar, saltwater.”)
Classification: List several materials and ask students to mark P (pure element), C (pure compound), HM (homog. mixture), or HT (heterog. mixture). Example list: Iron nail (P – element Fe), saltwater (HM), sand (could consider mostly SiO₂ but often has other components, likely HT mixture of particles), 14K gold (mixture of Au, Cu, etc. – HM alloy), coffee (HM solution of many compounds in water), concrete (HT mixture – sand, gravel, cement), oxygen gas (P – element O₂), blood (HT).
Purity & MP/BP: “How can measuring the melting point of a substance help determine if it’s pure?” (If it matches the known sharp MP of a pure compound, likely pure. If lower or a range, likely impure .) “What effect does dissolving salt in water have on the water’s boiling point?” (Raises it slightly .) “Why do we spread salt on icy roads?” (Salt lowers the freezing point of water, so ice can melt even when temperature is below 0°C).
True/False: “A homogeneous mixture has the same composition throughout.” (True). “Elements in a mixture lose their individual properties.” (False – they retain their properties, only in compounds are properties of constituents typically lost). “The boiling point of a liquid can indicate if it’s pure.” (True – pure liquids have a characteristic BP; mixtures often boil over a range or at different temp).
Separation question: “Which physical method would best separate a mixture of iron and sulfur powder?” (Use a magnet to pick out iron, or heating strongly could form compound FeS but that’s a chemical method – the better answer is magnet). “How to get salt out of saltwater?” (Evaporate the water; or distill and collect water leaving salt). “How to separate oil from water?” (Allow to settle into layers and decant or use a separatory funnel).
Short Answer: “Explain the difference between a compound and a mixture.” (Compound: substances chemically bonded in fixed ratio, can only be separated by chemical means, properties are unique; Mixture: physical combination of substances in variable ratio, can separate physically, components retain their properties).
Melting point scenario: “Substance X is known to melt at 120°C if pure. You test a sample and find it starts melting at 115°C and is fully melted by 119°C. What does that imply about the sample?” (It is likely impure or a mixture; the depressed and broad melting range indicates presence of impurities).
Mix vs Pure identification: “Is a packet of sugar (sucrose) a pure substance or mixture?” (Assuming table sugar is pretty pure sucrose, then pure compound). “Is steel (an alloy of iron and carbon) a pure substance?” (No, it’s a homogeneous mixture of metal and carbon, not an element or single compound).
Colligative property: “Why do antifreeze solutions protect car engines in both winter and summer?” (Because the solution has a lower freezing point than pure water – so it won’t freeze easily in cold – and a higher boiling point – so it won’t boil over in heat .) This tests understanding of impurity effect on FP/BP."
Chemistry,NSII,Unit 5: Solutions and Mixtures (Solisyon ak Melanj),:,"Konsantrasyon Solisyon ak Preparasyon (Solution Concentration and Preparation)
Learning Objectives:
Define a solution (solisyon) as a homogeneous mixture of one or more solutes dissolved in a solvent. Identify common solvents (water as the “universal solvent” in many contexts) and distinguish solute vs solvent in a solution.
Understand and use measures of concentration of a solution: especially molarity (M) – moles of solute per liter of solution, as well as simple mass per volume or percentage units if introduced (e.g., % w/v or % w/w). (Focus likely on molarity since it’s common in chemistry calculations .)
Perform calculations involving concentration: e.g., determine how many grams of solute are needed to prepare a given volume of solution at a specified molar concentration  , or find the concentration after dissolving a known mass in a given volume.
Describe the procedure for preparing a solution of known concentration from a solid solute: weigh the solute, dissolve in some solvent, transfer to volumetric flask, add solvent up to the desired volume, mix thoroughly . Emphasize safety (especially if solute is corrosive) and accuracy in measurement.
Explain terms saturated solution (when no more solute can dissolve at given conditions) vs unsaturated (more solute can dissolve). (Solubility will be covered more next video, but may introduce here conceptually that solutions have limits).
Recognize that concentration can also be expressed in other ways (like mass percent, ppm, etc.) but focus on the fundamental understanding of “amount of solute per amount of solution.” Possibly mention household concept like “5% vinegar means 5 g acetic acid per 100 mL solution” etc., if relevant.
Introduce concept of stock solutions and dilution concept (though detailed dilution formula may be next video – but can hint here or fully do in next). The competence list separates dilution to next, so likely leave detailed dilution for Video 12.
Key Concepts:
Solution: A homogeneous mixture where one substance (the solute) is dispersed uniformly at the molecular/ionic level within another (the solvent). The solvent is the component present in greater amount (often a liquid, e.g., water), and the solute is the component present in lesser amount (which dissolves in the solvent). Solutions can be liquid, solid (alloys), or gas (air).
Example: In saltwater, water is the solvent, salt (NaCl) is the solute. In brass, copper is the solvent (major part) and zinc is solute (minor part). In air, nitrogen is the solvent (~78%) and oxygen (21%) + others are solutes.
Concentration: A measure of how much solute is present in a given quantity of solution (or solvent). It quantifies “strength” of the solution. Many units:
Molarity (M): moles of solute per liter of solution . This is very common in chemistry because it directly relates to reacting moles. For example, a 1.0 M NaCl solution has 1.0 mole of NaCl (about 58.5 g) per 1.0 L total solution. If you had 0.5 L of that solution, it contains 0.5 moles NaCl. Symbol M or brackets [ ] around solute (e.g., [NaCl] = 1.0 M).
Mass per volume: e.g., grams of solute per liter solution (g/L). Sometimes used: e.g., glucose concentration in blood might be given in mg/dL. But g/L can be converted to molarity by dividing by molar mass.
Percent concentration:
% w/v: (grams of solute)/(100 mL solution) ×100. E.g., 5% (w/v) glucose solution = 5 g glucose per 100 mL solution.
% w/w: (mass solute)/(mass total) ×100, if both measured in grams (common in alloys or solid mixtures).
% v/v: (volume solute)/(volume total) ×100, for liquid-liquid solutions. E.g., 70% ethanol solution has 70 mL ethanol + 30 mL water per 100 mL (approximately).
(If curriculum doesn’t emphasize these, focus on molarity and maybe a mention of percent as everyday measure like 3% H₂O₂ solution or 5% vinegar).
Moles and molarity relationship: Molarity = moles/volume(L). Thus: moles of solute = Molarity × Volume (L) . And mass = moles × molar mass, so combining: mass needed = Molarity × Volume × molar mass. Use this formula to compute how to prepare solutions.
Preparing a solution of known concentration (from solid solute):
Calculate the required mass of solute using the formula above. (Example: to make 250 mL of 0.100 M NaCl: moles needed = 0.100 mol/L * 0.250 L = 0.0250 mol; mass = 0.0250 mol * 58.5 g/mol = 1.46 g NaCl).
Weigh out that mass of solute accurately on a balance.
Dissolve the solute in a small volume of solvent (usually in a beaker or directly in the volumetric flask) – swirl to help it dissolve.
Transfer the solution to a volumetric flask (if not already using one). Rinse the weighing beaker or funnel to get all solute in.
Add solvent (often water) up to the calibration line (the desired total volume). Do this carefully – use a dropper near the end to avoid overshooting.
Mix thoroughly by inverting the flask or stirring to ensure uniform concentration. Now you have the desired solution .
Emphasize using a volumetric flask for accuracy in volume (they are designed for a specific volume, e.g., 250 mL). If one isn’t available, one can measure with a graduated cylinder but volumetric is ideal for precise molarity.
Safety note: if solute or solvent is hazardous (like acid), you add acid to water, not water to acid (the adage “AAA: Always Add Acid” to water, to prevent splashing). For most salts in water it’s not exothermic enough to worry, but good practice awareness.
Example Calculation: “How to prepare 500 mL of 0.2 M CuSO₄ solution?” – calculate moles = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol; molar mass CuSO₄ ~159.6 g/mol, so mass ~15.96 g; weigh ~16.0 g, dissolve in some water, fill to 500 mL, mix.
Solution vs solvent amount: Clarify that concentration is per total solution volume, not just adding solvent to solute volumes. For instance, making 1 L of 1 M NaCl means final volume is 1 L, not taking 1 L water then adding salt (which would overshoot volume slightly). That’s why method is to dissolve then fill up to mark.
Solubility context: While not main focus yet, mention that for a solution to form, the solute must be soluble in the solvent. Water dissolves many ionic and polar substances (salt, sugar) but not nonpolar (oil). The maximum that can dissolve is its solubility. Usually our preparations are below saturation. If one tries to dissolve too much, some will remain undissolved (saturated solution). Temperature often affects how much can dissolve. (This leads into next video on solubility)."
Chemistry,NSII,"Unit identification: “If I say a solution is ‘0.5 M HCl’, what does that mean in terms of moles and volume?” (It means 0.5 moles of HCl per liter of solution). “A bottle reads 95% ethanol (v/v). Approximately how much of that bottle’s volume is ethanol?” (95% of it is ethanol, 5% other (likely water)).",:,"Dilisyon ak Solibilite (Dilution and Solubility)
Learning Objectives:
Explain what it means to dilute a solution – adding solvent to decrease the concentration of solute. Recognize that dilution does not change the total moles of solute, only increases volume.
Use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂ to calculate how to prepare a diluted solution from a more concentrated (stock) solution . For example, determine what volume of a stock solution is needed to make a given diluted volume and concentration.
Describe proper technique for dilution: e.g., measure volume of concentrated solution, transfer to new flask, add solvent up to desired final volume (not just adding a set volume of solvent, but adding until final volume).
Define solubility of a substance as the maximum amount that can dissolve in a given amount of solvent at a certain temperature . Distinguish between unsaturated (below solubility, all solute dissolves), saturated (at solubility limit, undissolved solute in equilibrium with dissolved), and supersaturated (rare case where solution temporarily holds more solute than typical, unstable).
Understand factors affecting solubility: temperature (solids often more soluble at higher T; gases less soluble at higher T), nature of solute/solvent (“like dissolves like” – polar dissolves polar, etc.), and pressure (for gases: higher pressure increases gas solubility).
Introduce the concept of solubility product (K_sp) qualitatively (since in competences)  – but perhaps only mention that for ionic compounds, there’s an equilibrium between solid and dissolved ions characterized by a constant (K_sp) at given temperature. For NS II, maybe just state that some salts dissolve only a little and K_sp is a measure of that (this might be advanced for NS II, but competences list “solubility product of ionic solution” so a brief introduction might be expected for stronger students). Possibly provide an example: e.g., AgCl has a very low solubility (K_sp ~1.8×10⁻¹⁰), meaning in a saturated solution [Ag⁺][Cl⁻] = 1.8×10⁻¹⁰, so extremely small concentration dissolves. But keep it conceptual.
Illustrate Le Chatelier’s principle in solution context (though might not be explicit): e.g., adding more solute to saturated solution doesn’t increase concentration (it just stays undissolved, eq shifts if at capacity), adding water to saturated solution allows more solute to dissolve, etc. (This links to equilibrium considerations).
Emphasize everyday solubility: sugar in tea (more dissolves when hot), gas in soda (CO₂ more soluble under pressure and when cold; opening bottle releases pressure, gas comes out).
Calculate simple solubility-related problems: e.g., if solubility of a salt is X g per 100 mL, how many grams can dissolve in given volume; or conversely how much will crystallize if solution cools (maybe beyond scope). Possibly skip heavy calc and focus conceptual.
Understand precipitation concept: if a solution is beyond saturation, excess solute will precipitate (come out as solid). When two solutions are mixed that can form an insoluble combination (like mixing AgNO₃ and NaCl yields AgCl solid), a precipitate forms. Recognize common insoluble substances (maybe mention solubility rules qualitatively: e.g., most nitrates are soluble, most silver salts are insoluble except nitrate, etc., but that might be a lot; maybe just give an example or two).
Possibly mention the product of solubility (the K_sp context: in a saturated ionic solution, the product of ion concentrations is constant). But if not going deep, skip numeric.
Key Concepts:
Dilution: The process of making a less concentrated solution from a more concentrated one by adding more solvent. When you dilute, the amount (moles) of solute stays the same, but the volume increases, so concentration decreases.
Formula: M₁V₁ = M₂V₂ , where M₁ and V₁ are the molarity and volume of the initial (often concentrated) solution, and M₂, V₂ for the final (diluted) solution. This formula comes from the fact that moles of solute initial = moles final. (M * V in liters gives moles; set initial moles = final moles).
For example: to make 500 mL of 0.1 M HCl from a 1.0 M HCl stock, calculate V₁ = M₂V₂ / M₁ = (0.1*0.500)/1.0 = 0.05 L = 50 mL. So one would take 50 mL of 1.0 M acid and add water until the total volume is 500 mL. (Emphasize adding acid to water).
Another: If you dilute 100 mL of a 2 M solution to a total of 400 mL, what is new concentration? Using formula or reasoning: M₂ = M₁V₁/V₂ = 2*0.100/0.400 = 0.50 M. (So 4x volume, 1/4 concentration).
Serial dilution: sequential dilutions can achieve big reductions in concentration (like 10-fold dilutions multiple times). Possibly mention how one might get extremely low concentrations by repeated dilutions (like homeopathic or laboratory serial dilutions).
Procedure for dilution: Measure the required volume of stock solution (using pipette or graduated cylinder), transfer to a new volumetric flask or container, then add solvent up to the desired final volume. Mix thoroughly. Do not just add the difference in solvent, because volumes may not be perfectly additive (especially if large amounts of concentrated acid, etc.). Usually safe but best practice is fill to mark.
Solubility: The maximum amount of a solute that can dissolve in a given amount of solvent at a specific temperature (and pressure for gases) to form a stable solution. Often expressed as e.g., “g per 100 mL at 20°C”.
If a solution has less solute than the solubility, it is unsaturated – all solute dissolves.
If the solution contains exactly the solubility amount, it’s saturated – any additional solute will not dissolve (it will just remain as solid). There is an equilibrium between dissolving and crystallizing processes at saturation .
Supersaturated solution: an unstable condition where the solution temporarily holds more solute than the normal solubility (achieved usually by dissolving at high temp and cooling slowly without crystallization). A slight disturbance or seeding can cause rapid crystallization of the excess. (e.g., sodium acetate supersat., or making rock candy from cooling saturated sugar solution).
Temperature effect: Generally, for most solid solutes, solubility increases with temperature (e.g., sugar dissolves much more in hot water than cold). A classic example: solubility of KNO₃ at 0°C ~13 g/100mL, at 60°C ~110 g/100mL (huge increase). However, some compounds decrease solubility with temp (rare for solids).
For gases, solubility decreases as temperature increases (gas escapes when warm – think warm soda losing fizz). And pressure effect: gas solubility increases with higher pressure (Henry’s law) – that’s why soda is bottled under high CO₂ pressure, and when opened (pressure drops) gas comes out of solution.
Polarity (‘like dissolves like’): Polar/ionic solutes dissolve well in polar solvents (salt in water, sugar in water), nonpolar solutes dissolve in nonpolar solvents (oil in hexane, grease removed by gasoline or nonpolar dry-cleaning solvents). Polar and nonpolar usually don’t mix (oil and water). This is due to the favorable interactions being similar in like substances. If needed, mention water’s hydrogen bonding can accommodate other hydrogen-bonding or ionic species, whereas oils rely on dispersion forces and don’t interact well with water."
Chemistry,NSIII,Chapter 1: Gas Laws and Gas Properties,Entwodiksyon sou Pwopriyete ak Konpòtman Gaz (Introduction to Gas Properties and Behavior),"Learning Objectives: Understand the basic state variables of gases (pressure – presyon, volume – volim, temperature – tanperati) . Describe how gas particles behave according to teyori sinetik gaz (kinetic theory of gases). Compare the properties of gases with liquids and solids.
Key Concepts: Gas particles move rapidly in all directions in empty space, colliding with container walls to create pressure. Pressure (presyon) is the force of particle collisions per area; it increases if more particles are in the same volume or temperature rises (particles move faster). Volume (volim) is the space gas occupies – gases expand to fill their container. Temperature (tanperati) reflects particle kinetic energy; higher temperature means faster-moving particles and higher pressure if volume is constant. Gases are highly compressible and assume the shape of their container, unlike solids (solids – sòlid) and liquids (liquids – likid).
Experiment Suggestion: Chofe yon balon epi obsève ekspansyon li (Heating a balloon to observe expansion). The instructor heats a balloon (e.g. by warm air or hairdryer) – students observe it inflate more, demonstrating that gas volume expands with temperature (Charles’ law concept). Alternatively, compress air in a syringe (with the nozzle capped) to feel increased resistance, showing that decreasing volume raises pressure (Boyle’s law concept).
Quiz Questions:

What causes gas pressure inside a container?
If the temperature of a gas increases while volume stays the same, what happens to the pressure, and why?"
Chemistry,NSIII,Chapter 1: Gas Laws and Gas Properties,Lwa Boyle ak Lwa Charles (Boyle’s and Charles’ Gas Laws),"Learning Objectives: State and apply Boyle’s Law (Lwa Boyle) and Charles’ Law (Lwa Charles). Interpret the relationship between pressure, volume, and temperature for a gas. Solve qualitative problems or predictions using these laws.
Key Concepts: Boyle’s Law: At constant temperature, the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to its pressure (if volume ↓, pressure ↑, and vice versa). Charles’ Law: At constant pressure, the volume of a gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature (if temperature ↑, volume ↑). For example, heating a gas-filled balloon makes it expand (Charles), and pressing a balloon reduces its volume and increases internal pressure (Boyle). These simple laws are specific cases of the ideal gas behavior. Note: Temperature must be in Kelvin (absolute scale) when applying Charles’ law. The concept of absolute zero (–273.15 °C) arises as the temperature at which gas volume would theoretically become zero.
Experiment Suggestion: Konprime lè nan yon sereng (Compressing air in a syringe) to demonstrate Boyle’s Law quantitatively – for instance, measure the volume at different applied pressures and observe the PV product ~ constant. For Charles’ Law, perform balon cho ak frèt (hot-and-cold balloon) demo – place one balloon in hot water and another identical balloon in ice water; the hot balloon expands, the cold one shrinks, showing volume change with temperature.
Quiz Questions:
Boyle’s Law: If the volume of a gas is halved (at constant temperature), what happens to the pressure?
Charles’ Law: Explain why a basketball left outside on a cold day appears slightly deflated (pressure constant).
Why must we use the Kelvin scale (absolute temperature) when applying Charles’ law?"
Chemistry,NSIII,Chapter 1: Gas Laws and Gas Properties,Lwa Gaz Ideyal ak Kalkil (Ideal Gas Law and Calculations),"Learning Objectives: Combine the simple gas laws into the Ideal Gas Equation (Ekwasyon Gaz Ideyal) PV = nRT. Calculate the mole (mol) amount, mass, or volume of a gas under given conditions . Apply gas law calculations to real-life situations (e.g. balloon lifts, gas production in reactions).
Key Concepts: The Ideal Gas Law PV = nRT relates pressure (P), volume (V), amount in moles (n), and absolute temperature (T) with R as the gas constant. Students learn to choose proper units (P in kPa or atm, V in L, T in K, R appropriately). This law allows quantitative calculations: e.g., finding the volume occupied by 2 moles of an ideal gas at 1 atm and 273 K (should be ~44.8 L). The law is an approximation that works best at low pressure and moderate temperature (gas particles far apart). Also introduced is the concept of molar volume at STP (standard conditions), ~22.4 L per mole for an ideal gas at 0°C and 1 atm.
Experiment Suggestion: Detèmine kantite gaz ki pwodwi nan yon reyaksyon (Determining the amount of gas produced by a reaction). For example, react a known mass of baking soda (NaHCO₃ – bikarbonat sodyòm) with vinegar (CH₃COOH – vinèg, acide acétique) in a balloon attached to a flask. The balloon captures the CO₂ gas. Measure the balloon’s circumference to estimate volume, then use the ideal gas law (assuming room conditions for P and T) to estimate moles of CO₂ produced. Compare with theoretical moles from the reaction stoichiometry.
Quiz Questions:
Use PV = nRT: Calculate the number of moles of gas in a 10.0 L container at 2 atm and 300 K. (R = 0.08206 L·atm/(mol·K)).
If 0.5 moles of an ideal gas are at 27 °C and 1 atm, what volume do they occupy?

Chemistry,NSIII,Chapter 2: Solutions and Solubility,Dlo kòm Solvan Inivèsèl ak Tretman Dlo (Water as Universal Solvent and Water Treatment),"Learning Objectives: Understand the unique properties of water (dlo) that make it the “universal solvent” (solvan inivèsèl) . Describe water’s molecular structure (bent shape, polar O–H bonds) and how it can act as both an acid and a base (amphoteric behavior). Define what qualifies as potable water (dlo potab)  and identify common impurities. Present various methods of water treatment (filtration, boiling, chlorination, distillation, etc.) to obtain pure water (dlo chimiquement pi) from different sources .
Key Concepts: Water’s polarity and ability to hydrogen-bond make it exceptionally good at dissolving many substances – hence “universal solvent.” It dissolves ionic compounds by surrounding ions (hydration) and pulls apart polar solute molecules via dipole interactions. Water auto-ionizes slightly into H⁺ and OH⁻ (this links to its acid/base property, covered in next chapter). Potable water is water safe for drinking – it should be free of harmful levels of microbes, salts, or toxic chemicals. Natural water (from rivers, wells, etc.) may contain suspended solids (e.g. mud), pathogens, or dissolved minerals. To obtain pure water, several treatment methods can be used:
Filtration (filtrasyon): removing solid impurities by passing water through sand, charcoal, or filter paper.
Boiling (bouyi dlo): killing microbes and helping some volatile impurities to evaporate.
Chlorination (klorinasyon): adding small chlorine bleach to kill bacteria.
Distillation (distilasyon): boiling water and condensing the steam to separate pure water from all solutes (produces chemically pure water).
Other methods: sedimentation, water softening (ion exchange resins), etc.

 Students learn how different sources of water (muddy water, tap water, well water, seawater, sewage water) can be treated by appropriate methods to yield clean water . This ties chemistry to a vital real-world issue – access to safe drinking water.
Experiment Suggestion: Filtrasyon ak Pirifikasyon Dlo (Water filtration and purification). As a simple project, create a DIY filter: layer gravel, sand, and activated charcoal in a bottle. Pour muddy water (dlo bouye) through – collect and observe clearer water coming out. Discuss that this filtered water might still need boiling or chlorination to be potable (to kill microbes). If available, demonstrate distillation: boil saltwater in a flask, capture and condense the steam, and show that the condensate has no salt (test by tasting or evaporating a drop to see no residue), whereas the original saltwater does.
Quiz Questions:
Why is water able to dissolve salt (NaCl) but not oil?
List two differences between pure distilled water and typical well water.
Given a sample of muddy river water, outline a process to make it potable. (What steps would you take?)"
Chemistry,NSIII,Chapter 2: Solutions and Solubility,Konsantrasyon Solisyon yo (Concentration of Solutions),"Learning Objectives: Define a solution (solisyon), solute (solite), and solvent (solvan). Express the concentration of a solution in multiple ways  – notably molarity (Molarité, moles of solute per liter solution), mass concentration (g/L), and recognize other expressions (percent composition, normality (Normalité), etc.). Perform calculations to convert between moles, volume, and concentration (C = n/V).
Key Concepts: A solution is a homogeneous mixture of a solute dissolved in a solvent (e.g. salt in water). Concentration (konsantrasyon) indicates how much solute is present in a given amount of solution. Common measures: Molarity (M) = moles of solute per liter of solution (mol/L); mass concentration = grams of solute per liter; sometimes % mass or % volume is used for mixtures. For example, a 0.5 M NaCl solution contains 0.5 mol NaCl in 1 L solution (about 29.25 g/L). We illustrate how to calculate the moles if given volume and molarity (n = C×V), or how to calculate required mass of solute to prepare a certain volume at desired concentration. Other forms like Normality or molality exist  but the focus is on understanding molarity and basic concentration units relevant to NS III.
Experiment Suggestion: Prepare yon solisyon sik oswa sèl nan konsantrasyon espesifik (Preparing a sugar or salt solution of a specified concentration). For instance, to prepare 250 mL of 0.2 M salt solution: calculate needed moles (0.05 mol NaCl) and mass (~2.9 g NaCl), then demonstrate dissolving that mass in a volumetric flask and diluting to 250 mL. This shows the practical steps of solution preparation (mesuring mass, dissolving solute, adding water to the mark). Additionally, visually compare two solutions of the same solute at different concentrations (e.g. food-colored sugar solutions) – the darker one is more concentrated.
Quiz Questions:
How many moles of NaOH are in 500 mL of a 0.1 M NaOH solution?
You have 5 g of KCl and dissolve it in water to make 100 mL solution. What is the concentration in g/L? (And in mol/L? Molar mass KCl ≈ 74.5 g/mol)
True or False: “A concentrated solution has a large amount of solute in a small volume of solvent.” Explain."
Chemistry,NSIII,Chapter 2: Solutions and Solubility,Konsep Mol ak Kantite Matyè (The Mole Concept and Quantity of Matter),"Learning Objectives: Grasp the concept of the mole (mol) as a counting unit in chemistry. Use Avogadro’s number (6.02×10^23) to convert between number of particles and moles. Relate moles to measurable mass and volume in practical terms .
Key Concepts: 1 mole of any substance is $6.02\times10^{23}$ particles (atoms, molecules, or formula units) – this huge number allows chemists to count atoms by weighing. The molar mass (mas molè) of a substance (in grams per mole) connects moles to mass: e.g. 1 mol of water (H₂O) is about 18 g. We can compute the number of moles from a given mass using n = mass / molar mass, or find mass from moles. Avogadro’s principle also states that 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies ~22.4 L at STP (standard temperature and pressure), linking moles to gas volume. This video solidifies the idea of quantifying matter in moles, masses, and volumes as needed in chemistry calculations  .
Experiment Suggestion: Peze 1 mol sibstans komen (Weighing 1 mole of common substances). Show students what 1 mole of a substance looks like: for example, measure ~58.5 g of table salt (sèl kwizin, NaCl) to represent 1 mole of NaCl, and ~180 g of glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) for 1 mole of sugar. Compare the powder volumes – even though both are 1 mole, their masses and volumes differ due to different molar masses and densities. This makes the abstract concept tangible. Another idea: Count 100 or 1000 of a small item (beans, paper clips) and extrapolate to imagine Avogadro’s number.
Quiz Questions:
Approximately how many molecules are in 0.5 moles of water?
You have 20 g of $\text{CO}_2$. What amount (in moles) is this? (Molar mass CO₂ ≈ 44 g/mol)
Why do chemists use the mole instead of counting individual atoms or molecules in the lab?"
Chemistry,NSIII,Chapter 2: Solutions and Solubility,Preparasyon ak Dilisyon Solisyon (Solution Preparation and Dilution Techniques),"Learning Objectives: Demonstrate how to prepare solutions of a given concentration step by step  . Perform dilutions of stock solutions using the formula C₁V₁ = C₂V₂. Convert between different concentration units (e.g. from g/L to M) . Emphasize good laboratory practice in solution preparation (accurate measuring, mixing).
Key Concepts: To prepare a solution: (1) calculate the required amount of solute; (2) measure the solute (solid or volume of a concentrate) accurately; (3) dissolve in a bit of solvent then fill up to the desired final volume. Dilution (dilisyon): when you add solvent (e.g. water) to a more concentrated solution, the amount of solute stays the same but spreads out in a larger volume – lowering the concentration. Formula: C₁V₁ = C₂V₂ (initial concentration × volume = final concentration × volume) helps determine how much stock solution to dilute. For example, to get 100 mL of 0.5 M HCl from a 2 M stock, use C₁V₁=C₂V₂ → V₁ = (0.5×100)/2 = 25 mL of stock + 75 mL water. Conversions: practice turning a mass concentration into molarity (requires molar mass), or molarity into % (requires density or total mass, if needed). These skills connect different ways to describe solution composition .
Experiment Suggestion: Dilye yon solisyon kolore (Serial dilution of a colored solution). Start with a brightly colored stock solution (e.g. a food dye or potassium permanganate solution of known concentration). Perform a stepwise dilution: take 10 mL of stock into 90 mL water (show new concentration = 1/10 of original), then repeat. Students observe the color fading as concentration decreases. This visual reinforces the concept of dilution and how concentration relates to intensity. Also, demonstrate conversion: e.g. measure the density of a salt solution and calculate percent by mass, then relate to molarity for advanced enrichment.
Quiz Questions:
How would you prepare 500 mL of a 0.2 M CuSO₄ solution? Outline the steps and calculations (CuSO₄·5H₂O molar mass ≈ 250 g/mol).
You have a 5 M stock acid. What volume of this stock is needed to make 100 mL of 1 M solution?
Converting units: A saline solution is 9 g NaCl per liter. What is its concentration in mol/L? (Molar mass NaCl ≈ 58.5 g/mol)"
Chemistry,NSIII,Chapter 2: Solutions and Solubility,Solibilite ak Fakè ki Afekte li (Solubility and Factors Affecting It),"Learning Objectives: Define solubility (solibilite) and terms like saturated (sasyete), unsaturated, and supersaturated solutions. Identify factors that affect solubility: nature of solute-solvent (polarity), temperature, pressure (for gases). Explain, with examples, why certain substances dissolve in water while others do not, using the rule “like dissolves like” .
Key Concepts: Solubility is the maximum amount of a substance that can dissolve in a given quantity of solvent at a specific temperature. If a solution is saturated, it contains the maximum dissolved solute; any additional solute will remain undissolved (precipitate out). Unsaturated means more solute can still dissolve. Generally, increasing temperature increases solubility of solids in liquids (e.g. more sugar dissolves in hot water than cold) but decreases gas solubility in liquids (warm soda goes flat faster as CO₂ escapes). Polarity (polarite): Polar solvents (e.g. water, dlo) dissolve polar or ionic substances well (salt, sugar), but not non-polar substances (oil). Water is a polar molecule with partial charges, so it attracts ions and polar molecules, enabling ionic compounds like NaCl to dissociate and dissolve. Non-polar solvents (like hexane) are better for dissolving non-polar solutes (grease, wax). Thus, the molecular structure (polar or non-polar) of a substance determines its solubility in a given solvent .
Experiment Suggestion: “Like Dissolves Like” Demonstration – Egzanp: Take two small cups: in one, mix a teaspoon of salt (sèl) into water; in another, mix the same into cooking oil. Salt readily dissolves in water but not in oil. Conversely, try iodine or a bit of food coloring that is oil-based in water vs. in oil – it dissolves in oil not water. Another experiment: create a saturated solution of sugar in hot water, then let it cool to see sugar crystals form (recrystallization) demonstrating saturation and temperature effect. These simple demos use everyday substances to illustrate solubility principles using divès sibstans nan lavi koteidyèn (everyday life substances) .
Quiz Questions:
You have a saturated solution of salt in water at 25 °C. What might you do to dissolve more salt – heat the water or cool it? Why?
Which of these substances is likely soluble in water: sugar, olive oil, or sodium chloride? Explain using polarity.
A carbonated drink is bottled under high pressure. How does pressure affect the solubility of CO₂ gas in the drink, and why does the drink go flat when opened?"
Chemistry,NSIII,Chapter 3: Acids and Bases,"Asid fò, Baz fò ak Kalkil pH (Strong Acids, Strong Bases and pH Calculations)","Learning Objectives: Distinguish between strong acids/bases and weak ones. Calculate the pH of strong acid or strong base solutions given their concentration (assuming full dissociation). Reinforce logarithm skills in pH calculations. Understand neutralization in terms of H⁺ and OH⁻ reacting to form water.
Key Concepts: Strong acids (e.g. HCl – asid chlorhydrique, HNO₃, H₂SO₄) dissociate ~100% in water to yield H⁺ (or H₃O⁺). Thus, the [H⁺] in a 0.01 M HCl solution is 0.01 M, giving pH = 2.0. Strong bases (e.g. NaOH, KOH, Ba(OH)₂) fully dissociate to yield OH⁻; for bases, we often calculate pOH first: e.g. 0.01 M NaOH has [OH⁻] = 0.01, so pOH = 2, hence pH = 12. Weak acids/bases (like acetic acid or ammonia) do not fully dissociate; their pH needs equilibrium calculations – those are more advanced, but qualitatively, weak acids have higher pH than strong acids of same concentration. This video focuses on strong ones for straightforward calculations. Also covered: neutralization reactions in terms of ionic equation: H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O. When an acid and base are mixed in correct proportions, they neutralize each other, forming water and a salt (ionic compound). The concept of equivalence (moles H⁺ = moles OH⁻) is introduced for understanding titration basics (though full titration techniques might be beyond scope).
Experiment Suggestion: Titrasyon senp asid-ak-baz (Simple acid-base titration demonstration). Set up a burette with a strong base (0.1 M NaOH) and have a flask with a measured amount of strong acid (say 0.1 M HCl, 20 mL) plus a few drops of phenolphthalein indicator (which is colorless in acid, pink in base). Slowly add base to acid until the solution just turns faint pink – that’s the endpoint where acid is neutralized by base. Use this to show that at neutrality, pH ~7 and moles of H⁺ = moles of OH⁻ added. If a full titration setup is not possible, an alternative is simply mixing measured acid and base volumes: e.g., 10 mL of 0.1 M HCl with 10 mL of 0.1 M NaOH – ask students to predict pH (it should be ~7, neutral salt formed).
Quiz Questions:
What is the pH of a 0.001 M HNO₃ solution? (Is this acidic or basic?)
You have a 0.005 M Ca(OH)₂ (strong base) solution. First, find the [OH⁻], then calculate the pH.
If 25 mL of 0.1 M HCl is exactly neutralized by 25 mL of NaOH, what was the concentration of the NaOH? (Assume strong 1:1 acid-base.)"
Chemistry,NSIII,Chapter 3: Acids and Bases,Echèl pH ak Oto-Iyonnizasyon Dlo (The pH Scale and Water Auto-Ionization),"Learning Objectives: Explain the self-ionization of water (autoprotolysis: $\text{2 H₂O ⇌ H₃O⁺ + OH⁻}$). Define pH and pOH, and understand the pH scale (0–14) as a measure of acidity/basicity. Determine if a solution is acidic, neutral, or basic given its pH or given [H⁺] or [OH⁻].
Key Concepts: Water auto-ionization: A tiny fraction of water molecules dissociate into H⁺ (which attaches to H₂O to form H₃O⁺, hydronium) and OH⁻. At 25 °C, pure water has $[H₃O⁺] = [OH⁻] = 1 \times 10^{-7}$ M. The ion product constant: $K_w = [H₃O⁺][OH⁻] = 1\times10^{-14}$ at room temp. This leads to the definition of pH: $pH = -\log_{10}[H⁺]$. In pure water, [H⁺] = $1e-7$ → pH = 7 (neutral). Acidic solution: $[H⁺] > 1e-7$ (pH < 7). Basic solution: $[H⁺] < 1e-7$ (pH > 7). The pH scale typically ranges 0 (strong acid, [H⁺] = 1 M) to 14 (strong base, [H⁺] = 1e-14 M), though values outside this range are possible for very concentrated or caustic solutions. pOH is similarly defined as $- \log[OH⁻]$, and for aqueous solutions at 25 °C, $pH + pOH = 14$. We emphasize that pH is a convenient way to express acidity: each unit change corresponds to a tenfold change in [H⁺]. Examples: gastric acid ~ pH 1–2, vinegar ~ pH 3, pure water 7, blood ~7.4, soap ~9-10, bleach ~12-13.
Experiment Suggestion: Mezi pH plizyè solisyon (Measuring the pH of various solutions). Use universal indicator paper or solution (or pH probe if available) to test a range of liquids: lemon juice, tomato juice, coffee, distilled water, baking soda solution, soap, etc. Have students record the color or pH reading and rank the solutions from most acidic to most basic. If using cabbage juice indicator, prepare it and add a bit to each solution in test tubes; observe the color spectrum (red/pink in strong acid, purple neutral, green in base, yellow in stronger base – depending on indicator’s range). This gives a visual of the pH scale in action.
Quiz Questions:
What is the pH of a neutral solution at 25 °C? What are the [H⁺] and [OH⁻] concentrations in such a solution?
If orange juice has a hydrogen ion concentration of $1\times10^{-4}$ M, what is its pH and is it acidic or basic?
A sample of bleach has pH 12. Is the hydroxide ion concentration high or low? (Bonus: calculate [OH⁻] roughly.)"
Chemistry,NSIII,Chapter 3: Acids and Bases,Entwodiksyon sou Asid ak Baz (Introduction to Acids and Bases),"Learning Objectives: Identify common acids (asid) and bases (baz) in everyday life. Describe general properties of acids and bases. Understand the Arrhenius definition of acids/bases (acids release H⁺ in water, bases release OH⁻ in water). Recognize some chemical formulas of acids and bases (e.g. HCl, H₂SO₄, NaOH, Ca(OH)₂).
Key Concepts: Properties of acids: taste sour (though students should not taste chemicals!), turn blue litmus red, react with metals like Zn or Fe to produce hydrogen gas (H₂), and react with bases to form salt + water. Examples: vinegar (contains acetic acid – asid acétique), lemon juice (citric acid – asid sitrik), battery acid (sulfuric acid – asid silfirik). Properties of bases: taste bitter, feel slippery/soapy, turn red litmus blue, and react with acids to neutralize them. Examples: baking soda (sodium bicarbonate – bikarbonat sodyòm, a weak base), lye or drain cleaner (sodium hydroxide – soude kaustique, very strong base), lime water (calcium hydroxide). Arrhenius definitions: an acid produces H⁺ (or hydronium H₃O⁺) ions in aqueous solution, a base produces OH⁻ ions in solution. This explains why acids generally start with H in their formula (HCl, H₂SO₄) and bases often contain OH (NaOH, KOH). We also note there are broader definitions (Brønsted: acid donates H⁺, base accepts H⁺), which explain basic substances like NH₃ that don’t have OH⁻ but generate it in water.
Experiment Suggestion: Idantifye Asid ak Baz ak Endikatè (Identify acids and bases with an indicator). Use indikateur papiyé tornasòl (litmus paper) or a natural indicator like red cabbage juice. Test household liquids: vinegar (vinèg) turns cabbage juice pink (acidic); baking soda solution turns it green/blue (basic). Lemon juice, soap water, soda, milk, etc., can also be tested to classify them as acidic or basic. Another demonstration: put a piece of zinc metal in dilute HCl – it bubbles (H₂ gas release) indicating an acid-metal reaction, but the same metal in a base like NaOH shows no reaction (most bases don’t react with metals in that way except aluminum/zinc amphoteric behavior).
Quiz Questions:
Name two common acids and two common bases you might find at home or in the kitchen.
What color change would you expect if you dip blue litmus paper into vinegar? And into ammonia cleaning solution?
According to Arrhenius, what ions are produced by acids in water? What about bases?"
Chemistry,NSIII,Chapter 3: Acids and Bases,Reyaksyon Netralizasyon Asid-Baz (Acid-Base Reactions and Neutralization),"Learning Objectives: Write and predict products of acid-base neutralization reactions. Recognize that an acid + base → salt (sèl) + water. Explore the reactions of acids with certain metals and carbonates to produce gases. Emphasize the practical importance of neutralization (e.g. antacids for stomach acid, treating acidic soil).
Key Concepts: Neutralization: H⁺ from acid combines with OH⁻ from base to form H₂O – a neutralization reaction. The other ions form a salt. For example: HCl + NaOH → NaCl (salt) + H₂O. Another example: H₂SO₄ + 2 KOH → K₂SO₄ + 2 H₂O. These reactions are usually exothermic (release heat). Beyond acid-base, acids react with carbonates to produce carbon dioxide gas: e.g. 2 HCl + Na₂CO₃ → 2 NaCl + H₂O + CO₂↑ (bubbling due to CO₂). Acids also react with many metals (those above hydrogen in reactivity series) to produce H₂ gas: e.g. 2 HCl + Zn → ZnCl₂ + H₂↑. (This ties into the reactivity series concept in the metals chapter.) We highlight that not all bases are soluble (those that are soluble are called alkalis); but soluble or not, acids will react with bases or basic oxides/hydroxides to neutralize. Application: if you have an acidic spill, you neutralize with a base (like baking soda); if a person has excess stomach acid, they take an antacid (often a carbonate base) to neutralize it, producing CO₂ burps.
Experiment Suggestion: Vinèg ak bikarbonat: reyaksyon ak karbonat (Vinegar and baking soda reaction). Mix vinegar (acetic acid) with baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) in a flask – it will fizz vigorously, producing CO₂ gas that can blow up a balloon or simply foam out. This is a fun demonstration of an acid + carbonate reaction yielding a salt (sodium acetate), water, and carbon dioxide. For a straight neutralization (acid + base), you can mix equal volumes of lemon juice and soapy water with a universal indicator – the final mixture should move toward neutral green color if properly balanced. Show that the temperature of the neutralized mixture rises slightly (using touch or thermometer) due to the exothermic nature of neutralization.
Quiz Questions:
Write the products (and balanced equation) of the reaction between HNO₃ and Ca(OH)₂.
Why does mixing baking soda with vinegar produce bubbles? What gas is in the bubbles?
If you have heartburn (excess stomach acid, essentially HCl), why might taking an antacid tablet (often CaCO₃ or Mg(OH)₂) help relieve it?"
Chemistry,NSIII,Chapter 4: Redox Reactions,Baz Oksidasyon ak Rediksyon (Basics of Oxidation and Reduction),"Learning Objectives: Define oxidation (oksidasyon) and reduction (rediksyon) in terms of both oxygen transfer and electron transfer. Identify the substance oxidized and reduced in a chemical reaction, as well as the oxidizing agent and reducing agent. Understand that oxidation and reduction occur simultaneously in a redox reaction.
Key Concepts: Originally, oxidation meant combining with oxygen (like magnesium burning in air to form magnesium oxide), and reduction meant losing oxygen (as in iron(III) oxide being reduced to iron metal in a blast furnace). In modern terms: Oxidation = loss of electrons, Reduction = gain of electrons (“LEO says GER” or in French OIL RIG: Oxidation Is Loss, Reduction Is Gain of electrons). During oxidation, the oxidation state of an element increases; during reduction, it decreases. For example, in the reaction: Zn + Cu²⁺ → Zn²⁺ + Cu, zinc metal loses 2 e⁻ to form Zn²⁺ (oxidation), and Cu²⁺ gains 2 e⁻ to form Cu metal (reduction). Zn is the reducing agent (it caused Cu²⁺ to be reduced by giving electrons), and Cu²⁺ is the oxidizing agent (it caused Zn to oxidize by taking electrons). Every redox reaction has these two halves. We emphasize recognizing simple cases: metal + oxygen → metal oxide (metal is oxidized, O₂ reduced); metal + acid (metal oxidized to cations, H⁺ reduced to H₂ gas); combustion of hydrocarbons (carbon is oxidized to CO₂, oxygen is reduced to H₂O).
Experiment Suggestion: Plake yon klou fè ak kwiv (Copper-plating an iron nail via redox). Place an iron nail in a copper sulfate (CuSO₄) solution. After some time, the nail’s surface turns copper-colored (a coating of copper metal forms) and the blue solution fades (Cu²⁺ is being consumed). This demonstrates a redox reaction: Fe is higher in reactivity, so iron atoms give electrons to Cu²⁺ ions. Iron oxidizes to Fe²⁺ (some iron dissolves into solution), and Cu²⁺ is reduced to Cu metal on the nail. This single-displacement reaction (Fe + CuSO₄ → FeSO₄ + Cu) is a clear example of redox. The students can identify which metal was oxidized (Fe) and which reduced (Cu²⁺). Another simple demo: show the tarnishing of a shiny metal over time (silver tarnish is Ag oxidizing to Ag₂S, needing oxygen/sulfur and an oxidizer).
Quiz Questions:
In the reaction: 2 Mg + O₂ → 2 MgO, which element is oxidized and which is reduced? Explain.
What does it mean in terms of electrons if we say “Fe²⁺ is reduced to Fe metal”?
In a redox reaction, the substance that gets oxidized is called the reducing agent. Why is this term appropriate? (What is it reducing, if it itself is oxidized?)"
Chemistry,NSIII,Chapter 4: Redox Reactions,Egzanp Redoks nan Lavi Koutidyen (Redox Reactions in Everyday Life),"Learning Objectives: Connect redox concepts to real-world phenomena and technologies. Understand the metal activity (reactivity) series qualitatively  and how it predicts which metals will oxidize more readily. Explore examples: corrosion (rusting of iron), combustion, bleaching, batteries (galvanic cells). Compare how pure metals and alloys differ in redox behavior (e.g. iron vs stainless steel).
Key Concepts: Reactivity series of metals: A ranking of metals by how easily they lose electrons (i.e. how easily they oxidize or how strong a reducing agent they are). A simplified series: K, Na, Ca, Mg, Al (very active, oxidize easily) > Zn, Fe, Pb (moderately active) > Cu, Hg, Ag (low activity) > Au, Pt (very unreactive). A more active metal can displace a less active metal from its compounds (e.g. Zn will displace Cu from CuSO₄, as seen in Video 4.1 experiment). This series also tells which metals react with acids: those above hydrogen (like Mg, Zn, Fe) will produce H₂ gas with acids, whereas Cu, Ag, Au will not  .

 Corrosion: is a redox process where metals are oxidized by oxygen (often with water present). Example: iron rusting – $\text{4Fe + 3O₂ + xH₂O → 2Fe₂O₃·xH₂O}$ (hydrated iron(III) oxide). Rust is porous, so it doesn’t protect iron; methods to prevent rust include painting (keeping O₂ out), galvanization (coating iron with a more active metal like Zn that preferentially oxidizes), or stainless steel (an alloy that forms a protective oxide layer).

 Combustion: burning of fuels (hydrocarbons) is a redox reaction with O₂ as oxidizing agent: e.g. $\text{CH₄ + 2 O₂ → CO₂ + 2 H₂O}$; carbon and hydrogen are oxidized, oxygen is reduced. Combustion releases energy (exothermic redox).

 Batteries (Galvanic cells): harness spontaneous redox reactions to produce electricity. In a simple Zn-Cu battery (Voltaic cell), Zn oxidizes to Zn²⁺ at the anode, Cu²⁺ is reduced to Cu at the cathode, and electrons flow through a wire – converting chemical energy to electrical energy. Though building a battery may be advanced, the concept is that redox can do useful work.

 Bleaching and corrosion inhibitors: Many cleaning agents are oxidizing agents (like bleach NaClO, which oxidizes stains) or reducing agents (like antioxidants in food preventing oxidation).
Experiment Suggestion: Seri Reyaktivite: Reyaksyon metal ak asid (Reactivity series demo with metals and acid). Line up small samples of different metals (e.g. Mg ribbon, Zn granule, Fe nail, Pb strip, Cu wire) and add a bit of dilute HCl to each. Observe and compare the vigor of H₂ gas bubbling. Mg reacts very vigorously (rapid bubbles, exothermic), Zn noticeably but slower, Fe slowly (maybe only slight fizz over time), Pb barely (due to protective PbCl₂ layer), Cu not at all. This visually reinforces the activity series. Additionally, show a piece of iron nail vs a galvanized nail (zinc-coated) in saltwater over days to see rust vs no rust. Or demonstrate a simple lemon battery: zinc nail and copper penny in a lemon, connected by wires to a small LED – it may glow faintly, illustrating chemical electricity from redox.
Quiz Questions:
Place these metals in order of reactivity (most active to least): Ag, Zn, Cu, Mg. Which of them will react with acid to produce hydrogen gas?
Why does iron rust more quickly in salt water or when two different metals are in contact? (Hint: think of a tiny battery cell forming, with one metal oxidizing faster).
In a Zn-Cu voltaic cell, which metal serves as the anode (gets oxidized) and which as the cathode (gets reduced)? What particles flow in the wire to create electric current?"
Chemistry,NSIII,Chapter 4: Redox Reactions,Nimewo Oksidasyon ak Balans Ekwasyon Redoks (Oxidation Numbers and Balancing Redox Equations),"Learning Objectives: Learn to assign oxidation numbers (nombre d’oxydation) to elements in compounds and ions. Use changes in oxidation numbers to identify redox processes. Balance redox equations using the half-reaction method in acidic or basic solution as required .
Key Concepts: Oxidation number (ON) is a bookkeeping charge assigned to atoms in compounds assuming electrons in bonds are given to the more electronegative atom. Key rules: free element = 0; for simple ions, ON = charge; oxygen is usually –2 (except in peroxides –1); hydrogen is +1 with nonmetals (–1 with metals like hydrides); the sum of ONs in a neutral compound = 0, in an ion = charge of ion. Students practice assigning ON to each element in examples like H₂O (H +1, O –2), H₂SO₄ (H +1, S +6, O –2), NaNO₃ (Na +1, N +5, O –2), etc. Recognizing a change in oxidation number between reactants and products indicates redox: if an element’s ON increases, it was oxidized; if it decreases, it was reduced.

 For balancing redox equations, we introduce the half-reaction method (particularly needed for reactions in solution, e.g. in acidic or basic media). Steps in acidic solution: (1) split into oxidation and reduction half-reactions; (2) balance atoms other than O, H; (3) balance O by adding H₂O, balance H by adding H⁺; (4) balance charge by adding e⁻; (5) multiply half-reactions to equalize e⁻ and add together; (6) cancel identical species. In basic solution, an extra step: after balancing in acid, add OH⁻ to both sides to neutralize H⁺ into H₂O. An example to demonstrate might be the permanganate and iron(II) reaction: $\text{MnO₄⁻ + Fe²⁺ → Mn²⁺ + Fe³⁺}$ (in acid), showing Mn goes from +7 to +2 (reduced) and Fe +2 to +3 (oxidized). It’s complex but a simpler one can be used if needed (like Zn + NO₃⁻ → Zn²⁺ + NO gas in acid). For NS III, the main idea is to be familiar with the process rather than doing very complex cases.
Experiment Suggestion: Balancing Act Virtual Lab: If available, use an online simulation or interactive tool where students can practice adding H₂O, H⁺, and e⁻ to balance redox half-reactions. Alternatively, perform a redox titration demo (like KMnO₄ titration of Fe²⁺ in acid) to show the reaction whose equation they can try to balance. For instance, titrating a solution of FeSO₄ with KMnO₄ (purple to colorless endpoint) demonstrates a redox reaction in acidic solution that students can link to the balanced equation: $MnO₄⁻ + 8 H⁺ + 5 Fe²⁺ → Mn²⁺ + 5 Fe³⁺ + 4 H₂O$. This connects the abstract balancing exercise with a real color-change reaction.
Quiz Questions:
Assign oxidation numbers to each element in $\text{K_2Cr_2O_7}$. Which element is likely getting reduced if this compound acts as an oxidizing agent?
In the unbalanced reaction $\text{Cu + NO₃⁻ → Cu^{2+} + NO}$ (acidic solution), which atom is oxidized and which is reduced?
Why do we need to add H⁺ (in acid) or OH⁻ (in base) when balancing some redox reactions? What do those species account for in the equation?"
Chemistry,NSIII,Chapter 5: Precipitation Reactions,Aplikasyon Reyaksyon Presipitasyon (Applications of Precipitation Reactions),"Learning Objectives: Understand how precipitation reactions are used in real-world contexts: qualitative analysis (to test for the presence of specific ions), removing pollutants from water, medical tests, etc. Develop strategies to design a sequence of precipitation reactions to separate ions in a mixture.
Key Concepts: Qualitative analysis: Many classic lab tests rely on precipitates – e.g. adding HCl to a solution: a white precipitate indicates silver (Ag⁺) or lead (Pb²⁺) as AgCl/PbCl₂; adding sulfate to precipitate BaSO₄ tests for Ba²⁺; flame tests aside, precipitation is key for identifying ions. Water softening: Hard water contains Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺ ions; adding washing soda (Na₂CO₃) precipitates CaCO₃/MgCO₃, removing hardness. Wastewater treatment: Certain pollutants (phosphates, heavy metals) are removed by precipitating them out – e.g. adding calcium hydroxide to precipitate heavy metal hydroxides. Medical example: In some blood tests or titrations, insoluble complexes form (though not classic inorganic precipitates, concept similar). Another interesting application: formation of kidney stones (calcium oxalate precipitate in kidneys) – an undesirable precipitation in the body, showing that solubility limits can have biological effects. Also mention that precipitation reactions are usually fast and practically complete (go to completion) because the insoluble product removes ions from solution.
Experiment Suggestion: Separasyon Ion pa Presipitasyon (Ion separation by selective precipitation). Give students a mixture solution containing (for example) Ag⁺, Ca²⁺, and Cu²⁺. Challenge: how to precipitate each ion out stepwise. For instance: add Cl⁻ to precipitate AgCl first (removing Ag⁺); filter it. Then add sulfate SO₄²⁻ to precipitate CaSO₄ (Ca²⁺ removal); then perhaps add sulfide S²⁻ or hydroxide to get CuS or Cu(OH)₂ for Cu²⁺. This is more of a thought experiment or instructor demonstration, but it illustrates the idea of using different reagents to target specific ions. Alternatively, demonstrate water softening: take “hard” water (could simulate by dissolving CaCl₂ in water), then add sodium carbonate – a white CaCO₃ precipitate will form, illustrating how the dissolved Ca²⁺ (which causes soap scum) can be removed.
Quiz Questions:
You suspect that a solution contains $\text{Ag⁺}$. What reagent could you add to confirm its presence via precipitation? What would you observe?
How can precipitation reactions help in making water potable (hint: removing heavy metal ions or excess minerals)?
If you have a mixture of $\text{Ba²⁺}$ and $\text{Ag⁺}$ ions in solution, which anion could you add to precipitate only one of them, not the other? (Think of solubility: e.g. sulfate vs chloride.)"
Chemistry,NSIII,Chapter 5: Precipitation Reactions,Entwodiksyon a Reyaksyon Presipitasyon (Introduction to Precipitation Reactions),"Learning Objectives: Define a precipitation reaction and identify its general form (AB + CD → AD + CB, where one of AD or CB is insoluble). Use a table of solubility rules to predict if a precipitate will form when two solutions are mixed. Write molecular, full ionic, and net ionic equations for precipitation reactions.
Key Concepts: In a precipitation reaction, two aqueous ionic solutions are mixed and an insoluble ionic solid forms, falling out of solution as a precipitate. Example: mixing silver nitrate and sodium chloride: $\text{AgNO₃ (aq) + NaCl (aq) → AgCl (s)↓ + NaNO₃ (aq)}$. Here AgCl is a white solid precipitate (insoluble in water), while NaNO₃ remains dissolved. Solubility rules: Students learn patterns – e.g. nitrates (NO₃⁻) and alkali metal salts are soluble; silver, lead, and mercury(I) chlorides are insoluble (so AgCl, PbCl₂ form precipitates); sulfates are soluble except BaSO₄, PbSO₄, etc.; most hydroxides are insoluble except those of alkalis and some alkaline earths (Ca(OH)₂ slightly soluble); most carbonates, phosphates are insoluble except alkali and NH₄⁺ salts. These guidelines let us predict precipitates. Net ionic equations: show only the ions that form the precipitate, omitting spectator ions. In the above example, net ionic: $\text{Ag⁺ (aq) + Cl⁻ (aq) → AgCl (s)}$. This focuses on the formation of the solid from its constituent ions.
Experiment Suggestion: Fòme yon Presipite (Forming a precipitate – hands-on mixing). Prepare a set of small test tubes and solutions: e.g. silver nitrate (AgNO₃), sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium iodide (KI), lead(II) nitrate (Pb(NO₃)₂). Have students (with safety gear, as AgNO₃ and Pb salts can stain/toxic) mix drops of different combinations on a spotting plate or test tubes:
AgNO₃ + NaCl → white AgCl precipitate (curdy white).
Pb(NO₃)₂ + KI → bright yellow PbI₂ precipitate.
AgNO₃ + KI → yellowish AgI precipitate.
Na₂CO₃ + CaCl₂ → white CaCO₃ precipitate (chalk).

 They observe the sudden appearance of a solid. Then ask them to write the chemical equation and identify the precipitate. If actual chemicals are limited, the instructor can do demonstrations or use a virtual lab simulation of precipitation reactions.
Quiz Questions:
When solutions of Na₂SO₄ and BaCl₂ are mixed, a precipitate forms. What is the identity of the precipitate? Write the balanced equation for the reaction. (Use solubility rules: BaSO₄ is insoluble.)
Explain what “spectator ions” are in a precipitation reaction. Identify the spectator ions when AgNO₃ reacts with KBr to form AgBr.
If no precipitate forms upon mixing two solutions, what does that tell you about the possible combinations of ions?"
Chemistry,NSIII,Chapter 6: Metal Reactivity and Extraction,Eksplwatasyon ak Metòd Ekstraksyon Meto (Mining Ores and Metal Extraction Methods),"Learning Objectives: Define what a mineral ore (minerai) is: a naturally occurring compound from which a metal can be economically extracted. Identify common ores of major metals (e.g. bauxite for aluminum, hematite for iron, galena for lead). Outline the general steps of metallurgy: mining, concentration of ore, extraction of metal (via chemical reduction or electrolysis), and refining . Compare extraction methods for metals of different reactivities : use of carbon (blast furnace) vs electrolysis, etc. Emphasize why highly reactive metals require more energy-intensive extraction.
Key Concepts: Ore: a rock or mineral that contains a sufficient amount of a metal compound to make extraction worthwhile. For example, bauxite is an aluminum ore (contains Al₂O₃∙H₂O); hematite is an iron ore (Fe₂O₃); chalcopyrite for copper (CuFeS₂); galena for lead (PbS); bauxite (boksit) for aluminum, etc. Many metals exist as oxides or sulfides in earth’s crust. Metallurgy steps:
Ore concentration: remove gangue (waste rock) to enrich the ore – methods include crushing and flotation for sulfides, magnetic separation, gravity separation, etc.
Chemical extraction:
Pyrometallurgy (using heat and chemical reducing agents): e.g. Iron extraction in a blast furnace: iron(III) oxide (Fe₂O₃) is reduced by carbon monoxide (generated from coke carbon + hot air) to iron metal. $\text{Fe₂O₃ + 3 CO → 2 Fe + 3 CO₂}$. Limestone is added to remove impurities as slag (calcium silicate). Iron is obtained as molten pig iron which can be further refined.
Roasting and reduction: e.g. for lead: PbS (galena) is roasted to PbO then reduced with carbon to Pb.
Thermite reaction (for certain metals like chromium): using aluminum powder to reduce a metal oxide (very exothermic).
Electrometallurgy (electrolysis): used for very reactive metals that cannot be reduced by carbon. Aluminum extraction via the Hall-Héroult process: purified Al₂O₃ (from bauxite via the Bayer process) is dissolved in molten cryolite and electrolyzed. At the cathode, Al³⁺ + 3 e⁻ → Al (liquid metal); at the anode, oxide ions give off O₂ gas (and unfortunately consume carbon anodes by forming CO₂). This process uses a lot of electricity, explaining why Al was rare before electricity availability. Similarly, alkali metals like Na or Mg are obtained by electrolysis of molten salts (NaCl, MgCl₂).
Refining: further purifying the crude metal – could be by electrolysis (as in copper refining: impure copper anode dissolves, pure copper plates on cathode), or zone refining for silicon, etc. We mention copper is often extracted by roasting copper sulfide to oxide then reducing, but also purified by electrolysis.

 Also discuss why metals are not found free: Most metals (especially reactive ones) form stable compounds (oxides, sulfates, carbonates) in earth’s crust . Only least reactive ones (gold, platinum, sometimes copper or silver) can be found in native state. Extracting metals from compounds always requires energy input, either heat or electrical energy, to overcome the stability of the compounds.
Experiment Suggestion: Ti rediksyon laboratwa (Small-scale metal extraction). One dramatic demonstration is the thermite reaction: Fe₂O₃ + 2 Al → 2 Fe (molten) + Al₂O₃, which produces molten iron. It’s spectacular but needs extreme caution. If not feasible, a milder experiment: reduce copper(II) oxide to copper. Mix a small amount of black CuO powder with carbon powder (charcoal), put in a sturdy metal test cap, and heat strongly in a furnace or over a burner – the oxygen will preferentially combine with C to form CO₂, leaving behind reddish copper metal (students can see copper color in residue). This simulates how carbon reduces metal oxides. For electrolysis: demonstrate water electrolysis (not exactly metal, but shows how electricity can cause decomposition). Or if available, perform a simple molten salt electrolysis in a crucible (like melting NaOH or ZnCl₂ with current – advanced). Otherwise, use video resources to show industrial setups (blast furnace animation, Hall-Héroult cell diagrams) to visualize extraction processes.
Quiz Questions:
What are the two main extraction methods for metals and for which types of metals is each used? (Hint: carbon reduction vs electrolysis – relate to reactivity).
Bauxite is an ore of aluminum. Why can’t aluminum be extracted from bauxite by simply heating it with carbon, like iron from iron oxide?
Write a balanced equation for the main chemical reaction occurring in the blast furnace for iron extraction (hint: iron(III) oxide + carbon monoxide). What element is the reducing agent in this process?"
Chemistry,NSIII,Chapter 6: Metal Reactivity and Extraction,Elektwoliz pou Pirifye ak Pwoteje Meto (Electrolysis for Metal Purification and Protection),"Learning Objectives: Describe how electrolysis (elektwoliz) can be used to refine metals (e.g. copper refining) and to electroplate a metal object with another metal for protection or aesthetics. Understand the setup of an electrolytic cell (anode, cathode, electrolyte solution, power source). Recognize examples of electroplating (galvanization, silver-plated utensils, chrome plating).
Key Concepts: In electrolytic refining, an impure metal is made the anode in an electrolysis cell, and a thin sheet of pure metal is the cathode. For copper: Anode = impure Cu, Cathode = pure Cu sheet, Electrolyte = CuSO₄ solution. When current passes, anode Cu atoms oxidize to Cu²⁺ (with impurities either not dissolving and falling off as sludge, or dissolving if they are more active), and Cu²⁺ ions from solution (or anode) reduce onto the cathode as pure copper. Impurities like Ag, Au from anode might collect as sludge and can be recovered. This yields high-purity copper as needed for electrical wires.

 Electroplating: using electrolysis to deposit a thin layer of one metal onto another object. For example, galvanization is actually usually done by dipping in molten zinc, but one can electroplate zinc onto iron as well: iron object as cathode, zinc metal as anode, electrolyte Zn²⁺ solution – zinc coats the iron, protecting it from rust (zinc corrodes preferentially). Silver plating: fork as cathode, silver bar anode, in Ag⁺ solution, deposits silver onto fork for shiny look. Chrome plating similarly uses Cr³⁺ solution to coat steel objects with chromium for corrosion resistance and appearance. Key point: at the cathode the metal cation is reduced to metal solid plating the surface; at anode usually the metal you want to plate from oxidizes to replenish cations (or an inert anode with metal ions provided by solution).

 Corrosion protection: aside from plating, mention sacrificial anodes – attaching a more reactive metal piece (like Mg or Zn block) to e.g. a steel pipeline or ship hull; that piece will oxidize (corrode) preferentially, protecting the iron (this is an application of the reactivity series and electrochemical principles). This is not electrolysis with external power, but an electrochemical cell preventing iron oxidation.
Experiment Suggestion: Electroplating a Metal Object. An accessible experiment is copper-plating a nail or key. Use a 6V battery, copper electrode (anode) and an iron nail or key as cathode. Submerge in an electrolyte of copper sulfate (add a bit of sulfuric acid or vinegar to increase conductivity if needed). After a few minutes, the iron object gets a reddish copper coating. This demonstrates electroplating (and also copper refining principle if an impure copper anode were used). For a purification slant, if you have two copper electrodes and run DC current, the cathode gains copper mass (pure copper deposited) and the anode loses mass (dissolves). Students can measure masses before and after. Emphasize safety (proper handling of solutions, no short circuits).
Quiz Questions:
In an electrolytic cell for copper refining, what is happening at the anode and at the cathode? (Which electrode gains mass, which loses mass, and what reactions occur?)
Why do we electroplate cheaper metals like iron with chromium or zinc for certain products? Give two reasons (one aesthetic or anti-corrosion).
You want to silver-plate a spoon using electrolysis. What should you use as the anode, the cathode, and what electrolyte solution is needed?"
Chemistry,NSIII,Chapter 6: Metal Reactivity and Extraction,Estrikti ak Pwopriyete Metalik (Metallic Structure and Properties),"Learning Objectives: Describe the structure of a metallic solid  as a lattice of positive metal ions surrounded by a “sea” of delocalized electrons (liaison métallique). Explain how this structure gives rise to characteristic metallic properties: electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, malleability, ductility, luster, etc. Compare the physical properties of metals with ionic or covalent solids.
Key Concepts: Metallic bonding (lyan metalik): unlike ionic bonds (where electrons are transferred and held in place) or covalent bonds (where electrons are shared between specific atoms), metallic bonding features atoms in a metal releasing some of their electrons to move freely through the entire solid. These free electrons act as a glue holding the positively charged metal ions in place. As a result:
Metals conduct electricity and heat well, because electrons (charge carriers) can flow freely.
Metals are malleable (can be hammered into sheets) and ductile (drawn into wires) because the metal ions can slide past each other without breaking the bond; the electron sea adjusts to the new arrangement, unlike brittle ionic crystals which shatter if like charges align.
Metals are lustrous (shiny) because free electrons can absorb and re-emit light across many frequencies.

 Examples: Copper is an excellent electrical conductor due to its metallic structure. Iron can be forged into different shapes because of malleability. We may also mention density and melting point: many metals have high density and high melting points due to strong bonding, though there are exceptions (e.g. sodium is soft with low melting point because its metallic bonding is weaker).
Experiment Suggestion: Konduktivite elektrik nan metal vs lòt materyèl (Electrical conductivity test for metals vs non-metals). Set up a simple circuit with a battery, bulb, and two test lead wires that can touch samples. Test various solids: a metal nail, a graphite pencil lead (also conducts somewhat), a piece of wood, a rubber eraser, salt crystals, etc. The bulb lights up strongly with the metal, dimly with graphite, and not at all with others. This demonstrates the unique conductivity of metals due to metallic bonding. Additionally, a simple malleability test: compare hammering a small piece of metal (like aluminum foil or a thin coin – it bends or flattens) vs hammering a mineral crystal or a lump of ionic solid like salt (it shatters). This highlights how metallic bonding allows deformation without fracture.
Quiz Questions:
What is meant by a “sea of electrons” in metallic bonding? How does this model explain why metals conduct electricity?
Why are ionic crystals (like NaCl) brittle, whereas metals (like Na or Cu) are malleable?
List three properties common to most metals and link each property to the underlying metallic structure."
Chemistry,NSIII,Chapter 6: Metal Reactivity and Extraction,Meto Piti vs Alyaj (Pèfòmans ak Pwopriyete) (Pure Metals vs Alloys – Characteristics and Properties),"Learning Objectives: Define an alloy (alyaj) as a mixture of a metal with other elements (usually other metals). Give examples of common alloys (steel, brass, bronze, etc.) and explain why alloys are made. Compare the properties of alloys with those of their component pure metals  . Understand how alloy composition can change hardness, melting point, corrosion resistance, etc.
Key Concepts: Pure metals often have high electrical conductivity and are very ductile, but some are too soft or reactive for practical use. Alloys are formed to enhance properties: for example, pure gold (24k) is very soft, so it’s alloyed with copper or silver to make 18k or 14k gold which is harder (for jewelry). Steel is iron alloyed with a bit of carbon (and other metals) – significantly stronger and harder than pure iron and more versatile (carbon strengthens iron’s lattice, disrupting dislocation movement). Brass = copper + zinc (more malleable than copper, lower melting point, good for instruments/hardware); Bronze = copper + tin (harder than copper, used historically for tools, statues). Properties differences: Alloys often have lower melting points than pure metals (e.g. solder, an alloy of Sn/Pb, melts at low temp). They can be engineered for special properties – stainless steel (iron + chromium + nickel) is resistant to rust because Cr forms a protective oxide. An alloy’s microstructure (solid solution or different phases) impedes layers of atoms from sliding easily, so alloys are typically harder and less malleable than pure metals. We also mention that because alloys are mixtures, they don’t have a fixed melting point; they melt over a range (unless it’s a eutectic composition).
Experiment Suggestion: Konpare fòm ak dite metal vs alyaj (Comparing formability and hardness of metal vs alloy). If available, show pure copper wire vs a brass wire of similar gauge – try bending each; both are malleable, but students might notice differences in stiffness. Or compare a pure metal item vs an alloy: e.g. pure aluminum foil (very soft) vs an aluminum alloy utensil (harder). Another demonstration: melting points – if one can safely heat, demonstrate that solder (Sn-Pb alloy) melts in a flame at a much lower temperature than either pure Sn or Pb would. If actual demo is not feasible, use prepared videos or data charts to discuss differences (like the famous comparison: pure iron nail vs tempered steel nail under stress, or pure gold vs 14k gold scratch test).
Quiz Questions:
What is an alloy? Name two alloys and the primary metals they consist of.
Why is steel (an alloy of iron) generally stronger and harder than pure iron?
A 24 karat gold ring is very soft and scratches easily. Jewelers prefer 14 karat gold (which contains other metals). What property improvements do you get by alloying gold with copper or silver?"
Chemistry,NSIII,Chapter 6: Metal Reactivity and Extraction,Seri Reyaktivite Metal ak Kwasans Karaktè Metalik (Metal Reactivity Series and Metallic Character),"Learning Objectives: Reintroduce and expand on the metal reactivity series (seri reyaktivite) , explaining why certain metals react more readily than others. Predict outcomes of reactions involving metals and compounds (like metal displacement reactions, metal + acid reactions) using the series. Understand the term metallic character (caractère métallique) in the periodic context – how it increases down a group and decreases across a period, linking to ease of oxidation. Relate the series to extraction: very reactive metals are hard to reduce to free metal, whereas low reactivity metals can be found native or extracted by simple means.
Key Concepts: The reactivity series orders metals by their tendency to lose electrons (i.e. be oxidized). A common list from most reactive to least: K > Na > Ca > Mg > Al > Zn > Fe > Pb > (H) > Cu > Hg > Ag > Au (Hydrogen included for acid reactions reference). Metals above hydrogen will displace H₂ from acids : e.g. Zn + 2HCl → ZnCl₂ + H₂↑ (Zn is above H). Metals high on the list (K, Na, Ca) even react with water at room temperature (sodium reacts vigorously with water, producing NaOH and H₂ gas). Mid-series like iron won’t react with water unless hot or steam, but will with acids. Low ones like copper don’t react with dilute acids or water. Displacement reactions: a metal higher in the series will take the place of a lower metal in a compound: e.g. Fe + CuSO₄ → FeSO₄ + Cu (Fe > Cu in series) – we saw this. But Cu + FeSO₄ → no reaction (reverse doesn’t happen). This can be used to extract metals in some cases (using a more reactive metal to precipitate a less reactive metal from solution).

 Metallic character: refers to how readily an element loses electrons (so it correlates with reactivity for metals). On the periodic table, metallic character increases down a group (atoms larger, hold outer e⁻ less tightly) and decreases across a period (atoms hold e⁻ tighter as nuclear charge grows). That’s why cesium (bottom of Group 1) is extremely reactive, whereas lithium (top of Group 1) is less, and nonmetals on right side like fluorine are instead gaining electrons (opposite behavior).
Experiment Suggestion: Vizualize seri reyaksyon metal yo (Visualizing metal reaction series). Continue from the earlier activity in Redox 4.3: try a metal displacement experiment. For example: put a strip of zinc metal in a copper sulfate solution (we know Zn will displace Cu, depositing copper). Conversely, put a piece of copper in zinc sulfate solution – no reaction (no change). Or: put a small piece of magnesium ribbon into solutions of other metal salts such as copper sulfate (Mg will win, forming MgSO₄ and Cu metal). Another demonstration: the reaction of metals with water – carefully show a very small piece of sodium (Na) reacting with water (done by teacher with safety precautions): it fizzes, moves around, possibly ignites. Compare with calcium granules in water (slower fizzing), magnesium in cold water (very minimal reaction) – illustrating how reactivity decreases from Na to Mg. These reinforce the ordering of the metals by reactivity.
Quiz Questions:
Which metal will react more vigorously with hydrochloric acid: magnesium or iron? Why?
If you place a silver spoon in a solution of copper(II) nitrate, will anything happen? What if you place an iron nail in the same solution? (Use the reactivity series.)
Explain why gold (Au) is often found in nature as a pure element, whereas sodium (Na) is never found as a pure metal in the earth."
Chemistry,NSIII,Chapter 7: Organic Chemistry – Carbon and Hydrocarbons,Atòm Kabòn ak Pwopriyete li (The Carbon Atom and its Properties),"Learning Objectives: Describe the electronic structure of a carbon atom (atomic number 6: 1s² 2s² 2p²) and how it leads to carbon’s valence of 4. Explain the ability of carbon to form up to four covalent bonds (single, double, triple) . Discuss the concept of catenation – carbon forming chains and rings by bonding to itself. Introduce carbon’s isotopes (¹²C, ¹³C stable; ¹⁴C radioactive) and one application (carbon-14 dating).
Key Concepts: Carbon is a small atom with 4 electrons in its outer shell (needs 4 more to fill octet). It achieves stability by forming four covalent bonds, which can be single (–), double (=), or triple (≡) bonds. Because carbon can bond strongly to itself, it can form an incredible variety of structures: long chains, branched chains, rings, and networks. This is why there is an entire field of organic chemistry dedicated to carbon compounds. Carbon’s ability to hybridize orbitals (sp³ for single bonds (tetrahedral geometry), sp² for double bonds (trigonal planar), sp for triple bonds (linear)) allows for these multiple bond types (though we may not dive deeply into hybridization, just mention bond shapes). Examples of carbon bonding: Methane (CH₄) – carbon with four single bonds (tetrahedral). Ethene (C₂H₄) – carbon with a double bond (planar). Ethyne/Acetylene (C₂H₂) – carbon with a triple bond (linear). Isotopes: ³¹₂C (~99%), ¹³C (~1%) are stable; ¹⁴C is formed in the atmosphere (cosmic rays) and is unstable (half-life ~5730 years) – its slow decay (¹⁴C → ¹⁴N via beta decay) is used for radiocarbon dating of organic materials (up to ~50,000 years old). Carbon’s unique properties: It forms the backbone of biomolecules and plastics; can form multiple bonds (e.g. C=C, C≡C, C=O); can form different allotropes (not in depth here, but mention diamond vs graphite as an illustration of different bonding arrangements: diamond = 4 single bonds in 3D network (very hard), graphite = layers of hexagons with sp² bonds (conductive, slippery)).
Experiment Suggestion: Modèl Molékilè Kabòn (Carbon molecular modeling). Use a molecular model kit or improvised materials (marshmallows and toothpicks) to build simple carbon-containing molecules: CH₄ (tetrahedral), C₂H₄ (planar with double bond), C₂H₂ (linear with triple bond), and perhaps benzene ring C₆H₆ (planar ring with alternating double bonds). This hands-on activity helps visualize how carbon bonds and molecular geometry. If available, show samples or images of pure carbon forms (a piece of graphite (pencil lead) vs a mock diamond or images of diamond) to discuss how the same element can have very different properties depending on bonding (though one is covalent network and other layered, beyond typical hydrocarbon structure).
Quiz Questions:
How many covalent bonds can a single carbon atom form? Why is carbon able to form so many types of structures?
What is the difference between carbon-12 and carbon-14? (Discuss protons, neutrons, stability.)
Draw or describe the bonding in an ethane molecule (C₂H₆) vs an ethene molecule (C₂H₄). How do the carbon atoms bond in each?"
Chemistry,NSIII,Chapter 7: Organic Chemistry – Carbon and Hydrocarbons,Chenn Kabòn ak Kalite Idwokabòn (Carbon Chains and Types of Hydrocarbons),"Learning Objectives: Define hydrocarbons (idwokabòn) as compounds containing only carbon and hydrogen. Classify hydrocarbons into categories: alkanes (alkàn), alkenes (alkèn), alkynes (alkin), and aromatic hydrocarbons (arèn) . Explain the difference between saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons . Identify structural features: straight chain vs branched vs cyclic hydrocarbons. Introduce terminology for classifying carbon atoms by the number of other carbons attached (primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary) .
Key Concepts: Alkanes: Hydrocarbons with only single bonds (C–C); general formula CₙH₂ₙ₊₂ for acyclic alkanes. They are saturated (maximum H per C). Examples: methane (CH₄), ethane (C₂H₆), propane (C₃H₈), up to decane (C₁₀H₂₂) and beyond. They mostly undergo substitution or combustion reactions and are generally less reactive than unsaturated counterparts.

 Alkenes: Hydrocarbons with at least one C=C double bond; general formula CₙH₂ₙ (for one double bond, acyclic). They are unsaturated (can add H₂ across double bond). Ex: ethene (C₂H₄), propene (C₃H₆), 1-butene (C₄H₈). Double bond gives reactivity (addition reactions) and possibility of geometric isomers (cis/trans) if internal (though mention only if time permits).

 Alkynes: Hydrocarbons with at least one C≡C triple bond; general formula CₙH₂ₙ₋₂. Ex: ethyne (acetylene, C₂H₂), propyne (C₃H₄). They are also unsaturated and undergo addition (can add 2 H₂ to fully saturate a triple bond to single). They have linear geometry at the triple bond.

 Arenes (aromatic hydrocarbons): contain benzene-like rings. Benzene (C₆H₆) is the prototype – a ring of 6 carbons with alternating double bonds (resonance-stabilized). Aromatics have unique stability (delocalized electrons). Common arenes: benzene, toluene, naphthalene. (We introduce the concept but don’t go deep into aromaticity).

 Saturated vs unsaturated: Alkanes are saturated (each C has as many H as possible; no double/triple bonds). Alkenes/alkynes are unsaturated (can add more H by breaking multiple bonds). Example: ethane (C₂H₆ saturated) vs ethene (C₂H₄ unsaturated).

 Carbon chain types: Carbon can form straight chains, or branching can occur (e.g. isobutane vs n-butane). Cyclic hydrocarbons (cycloalkanes CₙH₂ₙ) also exist (e.g. cyclohexane C₆H₁₂).

 Classification of carbon atoms: A carbon in an organic molecule is primary (1°) if it is bonded to only 1 other carbon (end of a chain), secondary (2°) if bonded to 2 other carbons (middle of chain), tertiary (3°) if bonded to 3, quaternary (4°) if bonded to 4 other carbons . For example, in isobutane (2-methylpropane), the central carbon is tertiary (attached to three other carbons), whereas the end carbons are primary. Recognizing this helps in nomenclature and understanding reactivity differences in advanced topics.
Experiment Suggestion: Idantifye Saturation ak Ensaturasyon (Identifying saturation vs unsaturation). Perform a simple chemical test: Bromine water test for unsaturation. Take an alkane (e.g. hexane) and an alkene (e.g. cyclohexene or use vegetable oil which has unsaturated fats) in separate test tubes. Add a few drops of bromine water (orange solution). Shake – the alkene (or oil) will decolorize the bromine (orange color disappears) as bromine adds across the C=C bonds, indicating unsaturation. The alkane (hexane) will show little to no color change without UV light (no reaction, since saturated). Safety: bromine water is hazardous; if not available, use potassium permanganate (purple) as an alternative test (Baeyer’s test): purple KMnO₄ is reduced to brown MnO₂ in presence of unsaturation. Students see that unsaturated compounds react, while saturated do not under these mild conditions. Additionally, use molecular models to build a small branched vs straight alkane to visualize primary/secondary carbons.
Quiz Questions:
What is the formula for an alkane with 7 carbons? What about an alkene with 7 carbons (one double bond)?
Explain the difference between a saturated hydrocarbon and an unsaturated hydrocarbon. Which type is more likely to rapidly react with bromine?
In the molecule 2-methylpropane (isobutane), classify the central carbon atom as primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary . What about each of the three CH₃ carbons attached to it?"
Chemistry,NSIII,Chapter 7: Organic Chemistry – Carbon and Hydrocarbons,Nonmen Idwokabòn (Nomenklati UIPAC Debaz) (Naming Hydrocarbons – Basic IUPAC Nomenclature),"Learning Objectives: Learn the IUPAC systematic nomenclature rules for simple hydrocarbons  . Name straight-chain alkanes from 1 to 10 carbons (methane through decane). Name simple branched alkanes (identify longest chain, name substituents as alkyl groups). Name alkenes and alkynes (including position of double/triple bond). Recognize and name simple cyclic hydrocarbons (cycloalkanes). Practice writing structural formulas from names and vice versa.
Key Concepts: Alkane names (Alkan yo): 1C methane (CH₄), 2C ethane, 3C propane, 4C butane, 5C pentane, 6C hexane, 7C heptane, 8C octane, 9C nonane, 10C decane  . Memorizing these roots is essential. Alkyl groups: substituents derived from alkanes by removing one H (general formula CₙH₂ₙ₊₁) – named by replacing “-ane” with “-yl”: e.g. CH₃– = methyl, C₂H₅– = ethyl, etc. Basic naming rules: Find the longest continuous carbon chain as the base name; number it from the end nearest a substituent or double bond (priority to functional groups like double bonds); list substituents with their numbers and names in alphabetical order. For example:  2-methylpropane (isobutane): longest chain 3 carbons (“propane”), one CH₃ substituent on carbon 2 → “2-methylpropane”. Another: 4-ethyl-2-methylhexane – a 6-carbon chain with an ethyl on C4 and methyl on C2. Naming alkenes/alkynes: Use the same root but change ending to -ene or -yne. Number the chain to give the double/triple bond the lowest position. E.g. 1-butene (CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₃) vs 2-butene (CH₃-CH=CH-CH₃). If multiple double bonds, use suffixes like -diene. Basic mention of geometric isomers: e.g. cis-2-butene vs trans-2-butene (not required in depth unless extension). Cycloalkanes: prefix “cyclo” + alkane name (e.g. cyclopentane for a five-carbon ring C₅H₁₀). For substituents on rings, number around the ring to give lowest numbers set.
Activity Suggestion: Nonmen ak Desine (Name and draw). Provide students with some structural formulas to name, and some names to draw structures. For example, ask to name: CH₃–CH₂–CH(CH₃)–CH₃ (answer: 2-methylbutane). Or draw the structure of “3-heptene” or “2-methyl-2-pentene”. They can use molecular model kits to build the molecule first, then translate to a 2D structure and name it, reinforcing spatial understanding. Also quiz naming of simple ones like the first 10 straight-chain alkanes and simple alkyl substituents. This could be done as a worksheet or interactive group quiz.
Quiz Questions:
What is the IUPAC name of the molecule with formula C₄H₁₀ that has a branching (a three-carbon chain with a one-carbon branch)? (Hint: longest chain 3 = propane base.)
Draw the structure of 4-methylhexane. Then identify all the primary and secondary carbons in that structure.
Name the following molecule: CH₃-CH₂-CH=CH-CH₃. Now name CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-CH₃ (if you find a difference). (This illustrates 2-pentene vs 1-pentene.)"
Chemistry,NSIII,Chapter 7: Organic Chemistry – Carbon and Hydrocarbons,Pwopriyete ak Itilizasyon Idwokabòn (Properties and Uses of Hydrocarbons),"Learning Objectives: Summarize some general physical properties of different hydrocarbons (state at room temp, boiling points, solubility). Discuss combustion as a key reaction of hydrocarbons (fuel usage). Give examples of common hydrocarbons or hydrocarbon products in daily life (natural gas, LPG, gasoline, lubricants, plastics). Touch on the concept of polymers as large hydrocarbon chains (like polyethylene).
Key Concepts: Physical properties: Small alkanes (C₁–C₄) are gases at room temp (methane, ethane, propane, butane); mid-size C₅–C₁₆ are liquids (pentane through hexadecane cover gasoline, kerosene ranges); larger are waxy solids or oils. Boiling point increases with chain length due to stronger dispersion forces, but branching lowers boiling point (less surface contact). Hydrocarbons are non-polar, so they are insoluble in water (hydrophobic, idwofòb), but soluble in non-polar solvents and each other. Combustion: All hydrocarbons burn in oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water (if complete combustion) releasing energy (exothermic). Example: $\text{C₃H₈ + 5 O₂ → 3 CO₂ + 4 H₂O}$; if oxygen is limited, incomplete combustion yields CO (carbon monoxide) or soot (C). This is the basis for using hydrocarbons as fuels (propane in cooking gas, gasoline in cars, candles from paraffin, etc.).

 Uses and examples: Methane is the main component of natural gas (gaz natirèl) for heating/cooking. Propane and butane are in LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) cylinders. Gasoline is a mix of C₅–C₁₀ alkanes and aromatics. Diesel is higher alkanes ~C₁₂–C₂₀. Lubricating oils and waxes are long chains. Plastics like polyethylene [-(CH₂-CH₂)-ₙ] are long-chain hydrocarbons made by polymerizing ethene; polystyrene comes from polymerizing aromatic vinyl (styrene). Many consumer materials (plastic bags, bottles, fuels) come from hydrocarbons (petroleum). Also mention that unsaturated hydrocarbons are useful in chemical industry – ethene to make ethanol or polymers, acetylene in welding (very hot flame when combusted with O₂). Aromatics like benzene, toluene are solvents and chemical feedstocks but toxic.

 Environmental note: Burning hydrocarbons produces CO₂ (greenhouse gas) and sometimes pollutants (unburnt hydrocarbons, CO, NOₓ). This ties chemistry to environmental science, showing both importance and impact of hydrocarbon use.
Experiment Suggestion: Konbisyon Idwokabòn (Hydrocarbon combustion demo). A safe small-scale demo: Soak a cotton ball in ethanol (or use a small alcohol lamp) and ignite it to show clean blue flame (ethanol is not a hydrocarbon (C₂H₅OH) but burns similarly; or use a small amount of hexane in an evaporation dish – caution!). For soot formation, show a candle flame – the yellow luminosity and soot deposition on a cool surface held above the flame indicates incomplete combustion in the flame’s interior (producing carbon soot). Alternatively, burn a small piece of paper or oil to show soot. If available, use a model car engine demo or combustion tube to pass the flame exhaust through limewater (Ca(OH)₂ solution) – it will turn milky (CaCO₃ precipitate) indicating CO₂ produced. Also, relate that water is produced – one can see moisture condensing on a cool surface held near flame. This confirms the products of hydrocarbon combustion.
Quiz Questions:
Propane (C₃H₈) is used as a cooking gas. Write the balanced equation for the complete combustion of propane. What are the two main products?
Why are hydrocarbons like oil and grease not soluble in water? (Use the terms polar/non-polar in your explanation.)
Give two examples of everyday materials or fuels that consist of hydrocarbons. Briefly describe the hydrocarbon type in each (e.g. butane in lighters – an alkane gas; candle wax – long-chain alkane solid).

Bonne étude tout moun – Bon etid tout moun! (Happy studying, everyone!)"
Chemistry,NSIV,Unit 1: Thermochemistry (Chalè ak Reyaksyon Chimik),Aplikasyon Tèrmochimi nan Lavi Toulejou,"Learning Objectives: Connect thermochemistry concepts to real-world situations. Understand how exothermic and endothermic reactions are applied or encountered in daily life and industry. For example, explain how instant cold packs and hot packs work, and the role of thermochemical principles in cooking, metabolism, and combustion engines. Emphasize the importance of energy changes in designing industrial processes (e.g. controlling reaction temperature for safety and yield).
Key Concepts & Terms: Hot pack (Paket chofaj) – typically uses an exothermic crystallization (e.g. sodium acetate) to release heat; Cold pack (Paket frèt) – often uses an endothermic dissolution (e.g. ammonium nitrate in water) to absorb heat. Combustion (Konbisyon) – a strongly exothermic reaction (burning fuel releases heat ); Photosynthesis (Fotosentèz) – an endothermic process driven by sunlight.
Experiment/Demo Suggestion: Show an instant cold pack activation (if available) as a live demo, or play a short video demonstrating it. Similarly, demonstrate a hand warmer (hot pack) crystallizing and heating up. If possible, have students mix baking soda and vinegar (vinèg ak bikabonat) which feels cold (endothermic reaction of acid + carbonate). Discuss why it feels cold (heat is absorbed).
Quiz/Activity: Research task – Have students identify one exothermic process and one endothermic process used in a technology or in nature. For instance, ask: “Why does sweating cool you down?” (Answer: evaporation is endothermic, absorbing heat). Quiz question: “Fuel combustion in a car engine releases energy. Is this energy absorbed by the reaction or given off, and how do you know?” (Answer: Given off – it’s exothermic, evidenced by heat and work output). Another question: “Cold packs often contain ammonium nitrate and water separated until use. What type of reaction occurs when it’s activated, and how can you tell?” (Answer: Endothermic, because it absorbs heat and the pack becomes cold)."
Chemistry,NSIV,Unit 1: Thermochemistry (Chalè ak Reyaksyon Chimik),Entwodiksyon a Tèrmochimi – Chalè nan Reyaksyon Chimik,"Learning Objectives: Understand what thermochemistry is and why energy changes accompany chemical reactions. Identify that reactions can either release heat or absorb heat. Recognize the law of energy conservation (lwa konsèvasyon enèji) in the context of chemical processes.
Key Concepts & Terms: Thermochimie (tèrmochimi) – the study of heat energy in chemical reactions; Energy (Enèji) – capacity to do work or transfer heat; Exothermic reaction (Reyaksyon egzotèrmik) – reaction that releases heat to the surroundings; Endothermic reaction (Reyaksyon endotèrmik) – reaction that absorbs heat, cooling the surroundings; Conservation of energy (Konsèvasyon enèji) – principle that total energy is constant in a closed system.
Experiment Suggestion: Simple Heat Observation – Dissolve calcium chloride (CaCl₂) in water and feel the container get warm (exothermic), then dissolve ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) in water and observe the cooling effect (endothermic). These safe, simple dissolutions let students feel temperature changes, illustrating energy release/absorption.
Quiz/Activity: Define exothermic vs endothermic in your own words. List two everyday examples of each (e.g. combustion of charcoal vs melting ice). Quiz question: “When an exothermic reaction occurs, what happens to the temperature of the surroundings?” (Answer: It rises, as heat is released). For an endothermic process, does the reaction vessel feel warmer or colder? Explain why."
Chemistry,NSIV,Unit 1: Thermochemistry (Chalè ak Reyaksyon Chimik),Mezire Chalè nan Reyaksyon – Kalorimetri Senp,"Learning Objectives: Learn how to measure heat changes in chemical reactions using a calorimeter (kalorimèt). Understand the concepts of specific heat capacity (chalè espesifik) and how the temperature change of water can indicate the heat absorbed or released. Perform basic calculations with $Q = m·c·ΔT$ to quantify heat.
Key Concepts & Terms: Calorimetry (Kalorimetri) – experimental technique to measure heat exchange; Specific heat (Chalè espesifik) – amount of heat per unit mass to raise temperature by 1°C (for water, $c=4.18 \text{ J/g·°C}$). Heat (chalè) – energy transfer due to temperature difference; Temperature (Tanperati) – measures average kinetic energy of particles.
Experiment Suggestion: Virtual Calorimeter Lab – Mix known quantities of warm water and cool water in a foam cup calorimeter to observe final temperature. Or, measure the temperature change when dissolving a salt (e.g. NaOH in water releases heat) in water. Students can use a thermometer (tèmomèt) to record initial and final temperatures and calculate $Q$. If a real lab setup is available, performing a simple neutralization (acid + base) in a coffee-cup calorimeter to measure the exothermic heat release is very illustrative.
Quiz/Activity: Provide a practice problem: “5 grams of a substance are burned in a calorimeter containing 100 g of water, causing the water temperature to rise by 8°C. If water’s specific heat is 4.18 J/g°C, how much heat was released?” Have students calculate $Q$ (Answer: $Q = 100 \times 4.18 \times 8 ≈ 3344 \text{ J}$, meaning ~3.3 kJ released). Ask conceptual questions like “Why is a Styrofoam cup used in simple calorimetry?” or “If the temperature drops in the calorimeter, what does that indicate about the reaction?” (It’s endothermic, absorbing heat from water)."
Chemistry,NSIV,Unit 1: Thermochemistry (Chalè ak Reyaksyon Chimik),Reyaksyon Egzotèrmik ak Endotèrmik – Egzanp ak Dyagram Enèji,"Learning Objectives: Distinguish clearly between exothermic and endothermic reactions by definition and by analyzing energy profiles. Interpret energy level diagrams for reactions, identifying reactant energy, product energy, and the enthalpy change (chanjman anthalpi) ΔH. Understand that exothermic reactions have ΔH < 0 (energy released) while endothermic have ΔH > 0 (energy absorbed).
Key Concepts & Terms: Enthalpy (Anthalpi) – the heat content of a system at constant pressure; ΔH (Chanjman entalpi) – change in enthalpy during a reaction (negative for exothermic, positive for endothermic). Energy profile diagram (Dyagram nivo enèji) – a graph showing energy of reactants and products; Activation energy (Enèji aktivasyon) – the minimum energy needed to initiate a reaction (will be introduced qualitatively here).
Experiment Suggestion: Use a virtual simulation or drawn diagram to show a reaction energy diagram. For example, illustrate the energy curve for the combustion of methane (exothermic) versus the thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate (endothermic). Have students label ΔH and the relative energies of reactants vs products on each curve.
Quiz/Activity: Given an energy diagram with reactants higher than products, identify if the reaction is exo- or endothermic and justify your answer. Short exercise: Calculate the overall ΔH for a reaction given bond energies (for advanced students), or qualitatively rank given processes as exo/endothermic. Quiz question: “In an exothermic reaction, is ΔH positive or negative, and why?” (Answer: ΔH is negative because the reaction releases heat, resulting in products with lower energy than reactants)."
Chemistry,NSIV,Unit 2: Reaction Rates (Vitès Reyaksyon – Cinétique Chimique),Entwodiksyon a Vitès Reyaksyon – Ki jan vit Reaksyon Chimik yo ye?,"Learning Objectives: Define what the rate of a chemical reaction is and why it matters. Understand that reaction rate measures how fast reactants are consumed or products are formed over time. Introduce the idea that different reactions proceed at different speeds (for example, rusting is slow, explosions are fast). Learn common units of reaction rate (e.g. M/s, or qualitative terms like “fast/slow”).
Key Concepts & Terms: Reaction rate (vitès reyaksyon) – change in concentration of reactant or product per unit time; Kinetic theory (teori sinetik) – idea that particle collisions underlie reactions; Collision – reactant particles must collide to react; Effective collision (kolizyon efikas) – a collision with proper orientation and energy to lead to reaction. (These concepts set the stage for deeper understanding in the next video.)
Experiment Suggestion: Simple Rate Observation – Compare the effervescence when an effervescent tablet (Alka-Seltzer) is placed in cold water vs. hot water. Students observe that the tablet dissolves and reacts much faster in hot water. This introduces qualitatively that temperature affects reaction rate. Another simple demo: Expose a piece of iron to air vs a burning of steel wool; rusting vs burning illustrate slow vs fast oxidation.
Quiz/Activity: Ask students: “How can you tell if a reaction is fast or slow? What evidence would you look for?” (Expected: how quickly observable changes occur, like gas bubbling, color change, temperature change). Quiz question: “Define reaction rate in terms of reactant or product concentration.” (Answer: e.g. the change in concentration of a reactant or product divided by the time interval for that change). Give a simple scenario: “In 10 seconds, 5 grams of reactant decomposed. What is the average rate of reaction in grams per second?” and have them calculate."
Chemistry,NSIV,Unit 2: Reaction Rates (Vitès Reyaksyon – Cinétique Chimique),Faktè ki Enfliyanse Vitès Reyaksyon – Teori Kolizyon,"Learning Objectives: Understand the Collision Theory (Teori Kolizyon) basis for reaction rates: reactions occur when reacting particles effectively collide. Learn the key factors that affect how often and how effectively collisions happen, thus influencing rate: (1) Concentration of reactants, (2) Temperature, (3) Physical state & surface area, (4) Presence of a catalyst, (5) Nature of the reactants. For each factor, grasp qualitatively why it changes the rate (e.g. higher concentration means more frequent collisions). Recognize the concept of activation energy (enèji aktivasyon) as the minimum energy required for an effective collision, and how temperature influences the fraction of molecules that can overcome this energy barrier.
Key Concepts & Terms: Concentration (Konsantrasyon) – higher concentration = more particles in a volume = more collisions per second; Temperature (Tanperati) – higher temperature = particles move faster, collide more often and with greater energy, increasing reaction rate . Surface area (Sifas kontak) – for solids, more finely divided (powder vs. chunk) means more area for collisions. Nature of reactants (nati rezaktan) – some substances react more readily (e.g. reactive metals vs noble metals) due to bond strengths or complexity. Activation energy – energy threshold for reaction; Collision orientation – molecules must collide in the correct orientation to form products.
Experiment Suggestion: Multi-Factor Demo – Use the decomposition of effervescent tablets again to demonstrate factors: show that crushed tablet vs whole tablet (surface area) affects rate (crushed dissolves faster). Show that adding more tablets at once (higher concentration of reactant) makes more vigorous bubbling. Refer back to hot vs cold water example for temperature. If possible, demonstrate a simple catalyst effect (see next video suggestion).
Quiz/Activity: List the five factors and describe how each affects reaction rate. For example: “Why does food spoil slower in a fridge?” (Lower temperature slows reactions of spoilage). Quiz question: “If you increase the concentration of a reactant, what happens to the rate of reaction and why?” (Answer: The rate increases because there are more frequent collisions among reactant particles). Another: “Why does a lump of sugar dissolve slower than an equal mass of granulated sugar?” (Surface area effect – less area for collisions). Provide a scenario and ask which factor is at play: “Wood shavings catch fire more easily than a log – which factor is this illustrating?” (Surface area/nature of reactant)."
Chemistry,NSIV,Unit 2: Reaction Rates (Vitès Reyaksyon – Cinétique Chimique),Katalisè ak Reyaksyon – Wòl Katalis nan Vitès Reyaksyon,"Learning Objectives: Explain what a catalyst (katalisè) is and how it influences reaction rate without being consumed. Understand that a catalyst provides an alternative pathway with lower activation energy, thus increasing the fraction of effective collisions. Distinguish between a catalyst and an intermediate (catalyst is regenerated at end). Introduce examples of catalysts in industry (e.g. catalytic converters in cars, enzymes in the body). Emphasize that catalysts speed up both the forward and reverse reactions (important later for equilibrium considerations).
Key Concepts & Terms: Catalyst (Katalisè) – a substance that increases the reaction rate by lowering activation energy, and is not permanently consumed; Enzyme (Anzim) – biological catalyst (protein) in living organisms; Inhibitor (Inibitè) – opposite of a catalyst, a substance that slows reactions (mention for completeness). Activation energy diagram – show how catalyst lowers the peak of energy barrier.
Experiment Suggestion: Catalyst Demo – A classic small-scale demo is the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) with and without a catalyst. Use a dilute hydrogen peroxide solution: first, show it decomposes slowly on its own (maybe a glowing splint test shows slow oxygen evolution). Then add a bit of manganese dioxide (MnO₂) or even yeast (which has the enzyme catalase) to act as catalyst – the reaction (marked by rapid bubbling of oxygen) speeds up dramatically. This vividly shows the effect of a catalyst on reaction rate. (Safety: wear goggles, as H₂O₂ can irritate skin; use low concentration for safety.)
Quiz/Activity: Ask: “Does a catalyst get used up in a reaction? Explain.” (Expected: No, it may participate in intermediate steps but is regenerated; it can be reused). Quiz question: “How does a catalyst increase the rate of a reaction?” with multiple-choice answers like (A) It raises the temperature, (B) It lowers the activation energy , (C) It increases reactant concentration, (D) It supplies extra energy to reactants. (Correct: B, lowers activation energy). As an activity, have students research one example of a catalyst used in industry or biology (e.g. the enzyme lactase in our bodies, or iron catalyst in ammonia synthesis) and report how it helps that reaction."
Chemistry,NSIV,Unit 3: Chemical Equilibrium (Ekilib Chimik – Équilibre Chimique),Entwodiksyon ak Ekilib Chimik – Reaksyon Reyèsib,"Learning Objectives: Grasp the concept of a reversible reaction (reaksyon reyèsib) and how it leads to chemical equilibrium. Learn that at equilibrium, the forward and reverse reaction rates are equal, resulting in stable concentrations of reactants and products . Emphasize that equilibrium is dynamic: reactions continue to occur in both directions, but overall concentrations don’t change. Understand the visual notation of equilibrium (double arrow ⇌). Recognize examples of equilibrium in everyday life (like a saturated solution, or a bottle of soda with CO₂ gas dissolving and coming out).
Key Concepts & Terms: Reversible reaction (Reyaksyon reyèsib) – one that can proceed in both forward and backward directions; Dynamic equilibrium (ekilib dinamik) – state of balance where two opposite processes occur at equal rates ; Forward reaction (reaksyon ale) vs Reverse reaction (reaksyon tounen); Equilibrium state (eta ekilib) – no net change in amounts of reactants/products over time . Also introduce Le Châtelier’s principle name (to be detailed next video).
Experiment Suggestion: Physical Equilibrium Demonstration – Show a simple physical analogy: Two connected flasks with water and a dye (or two burettes connected with a tube). Initially one side has colored water and the other clear; over time the color (or water level) evens out as transfer happens in both directions. This mimics dynamic equilibrium. Alternatively, a saturated sodium chloride solution in a closed flask demonstrates equilibrium between dissolved salt and undissolved salt (solid ↔ dissolved). Explain that although dissolving and crystallization continue, the amount dissolved stays constant at equilibrium.
Quiz/Activity: Quiz question: “Complete the sentence: Chemical equilibrium is reached in a reversible reaction when ___.” (Answer: when the forward reaction rate equals the reverse reaction rate , so concentrations remain constant). Ask students to consider: “If a reaction has reached equilibrium, does it mean the reaction has stopped? Why or why not?” (Expected: No, it hasn’t stopped; forward and reverse reactions continue happening, but at the same rate – dynamic equilibrium). Provide a simple equilibrium reaction (e.g. ${\text{N}_2O_4 (g) ⇌ 2 NO_2 (g)}$, a colorless gas ⇌ brown gas) and ask what they would observe as it reaches equilibrium in a closed container (the color stabilizes at some intermediate shade, indicating both species present)."
Chemistry,NSIV,Unit 3: Chemical Equilibrium (Ekilib Chimik – Équilibre Chimique),Konstann Ekilib – Kₑ ak Kₚ (Eksprèsyon Matematik Ekilib),"Learning Objectives: Introduce the equilibrium constant and how it quantifies the ratio of products to reactants at equilibrium. Define $K_c$ (konstann ekilib konsantrasyon) in terms of concentrations for a general reaction aA + bB ⇌ cC + dD as $K_c = \frac{[C]^c[D]^d}{[A]^a[B]^b} $. Understand what the magnitude of $K$ implies: $K \gg 1$ means products are favored at equilibrium (mostly products formed), $K \ll 1$ means reactants are favored . If applicable, mention $K_p$ for gaseous equilibria in terms of partial pressures. Emphasize that $K$ is constant at a given temperature (temperature is the only factor that changes $K$ value). This video can be more optional/advanced if students are comfortable with basic algebra.
Key Concepts & Terms: Equilibrium constant ($K_c$) – numerical value characterizing equilibrium composition ; $K_p$ – equilibrium constant in terms of pressure (for gases); Reaction quotient ($Q$) – similar ratio calculated for non-equilibrium conditions (to predict direction of shift, though this might be advanced – can be briefly noted). Homogeneous vs Heterogeneous equilibrium – mention that pure solids/liquids are omitted from $K$ expressions (advanced note).
Experiment Suggestion: Use the iron thiocyanate equilibrium (Fe³⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ Fe(SCN)²⁺, which forms a blood-red complex) to illustrate $K_c$ calculation. Prepare a series of mixtures with known initial concentrations of Fe³⁺ and SCN⁻, let them reach equilibrium (red color appears), and spectrophotometrically or visually compare intensities to deduce [Fe(SCN)²⁺] at equilibrium. Then show how plugging these concentrations into the $K_c$ expression gives a constant value for all mixtures (this is a common lab experiment in chemistry class). If actual lab is not possible, a theoretical data set or simulation can be discussed.
Quiz/Activity: Give a simple equilibrium with numbers: e.g. “At equilibrium, [H₂]=0.2 M, [I₂]=0.2 M, [HI]=1.2 M for the reaction ${\text{H}_2 + \text{I}_2 ⇌ 2 HI}$. Calculate $K_c$.” Have students compute $K_c = \frac{[HI]^2}{[H₂][I₂]} = \frac{(1.2)^2}{(0.2)(0.2)} = 36$. Then ask: “Is this reaction product-favored or reactant-favored at equilibrium?” (Answer: $K_c=36 \gg 1$, so product-favored). Quiz question: “What does it mean if $K_c$ of a reaction is much less than 1?” (Answer: At equilibrium there are mostly reactants, the forward reaction is not favored). As an extension, ask how $K$ would change if temperature is increased for an exothermic reaction (it would decrease, since heating favors reactants, but that might be an advanced concept linking equilibrium and thermochemistry)."
Chemistry,NSIV,Unit 3: Chemical Equilibrium (Ekilib Chimik – Équilibre Chimique),Prensip Le Châtelier – Kijan Ekilib Reyaji a Chanjman,"Learning Objectives: Understand Le Châtelier’s Principle – if a stress (change in conditions) is applied to a system at equilibrium, the system will adjust (shift) to partially counteract that change and re-establish equilibrium. Learn the common stresses: change in concentration, temperature, or pressure/volume (for gaseous equilibria). Predict qualitatively the direction of shift (toward products or reactants) when these changes occur. Recognize that catalysts do not change the position of equilibrium (they just help reach equilibrium faster).
Key Concepts & Terms: Le Châtelier’s Principle (Prensip Le Châtelier) – a rule for predicting equilibrium shifts ; “Shift to the right” (desantrase adwat) – means the forward reaction is favored, producing more products; “Shift to the left” (desantrase agoch) – means the reverse reaction is favored, producing more reactants. Stress – any change in concentration, pressure, or temperature that disturbs equilibrium. Exothermic vs Endothermic in equilibrium context – raising temperature favors the endothermic direction (heat as a “component” of the reaction).
Experiment Suggestion: Equilibrium Shift Demonstration – A classic visual demo: the chromate-dichromate equilibrium. Prepare a solution of potassium chromate (yellow, ${\text{2 CrO}_4^{2-} + 2H^+ ⇌ \text{Cr}_2\text{O}_7^{2-} + \text{H}_2O}$ which is dichromate, orange). Show that adding acid (H⁺) drives the equilibrium to orange (dichromate), while adding base (OH⁻) consumes H⁺ and shifts it back to yellow (chromate). This dramatically shows Le Châtelier’s principle with color change. Another one: cobalt(II) chloride in water (pink) vs addition of HCl (blue complex forms) – temperature or concentration shifts can be shown (if available).
Quiz/Activity: Provide scenarios for students to predict shifts. For example: “In the equilibrium ${\text{N}_2 + 3H_2 ⇌ 2NH_3}$ (exothermic forward), what happens if we remove NH₃ as it forms?” (Answer: the equilibrium shifts right to produce more NH₃). “What if we increase the temperature?” (Shifts left, favoring reactants, because the forward reaction is exothermic). Quiz questions: (1) “According to Le Châtelier, how will an equilibrium respond to an increase in pressure?” (Answer: It will shift toward the side with fewer moles of gas, to reduce pressure). (2) True/False: “A catalyst will cause the equilibrium to shift to the product side.” (Answer: False – no shift, it only speeds reaching equilibrium). Have students explain each answer for understanding."
Chemistry,NSIV,Unit 4: Acids and Bases (Reyaksyon Asid-Baz – Réactions Acide-Base),Definisyon Asid ak Baz – Arrhenius ak Brønsted-Lowry,"Learning Objectives: Define acids (asid) and bases (baz) using both Arrhenius and Brønsted-Lowry theories. According to Arrhenius, an acid produces H⁺ (H₃O⁺) in aqueous solution and a base produces OH⁻ in solution. According to Brønsted-Lowry, an acid is a proton donor and a base is a proton acceptor . Illustrate these definitions with examples (HCl is an acid, NaOH a base in both definitions; NH₃ is not an Arrhenius base but is a Brønsted base because it accepts a proton). Introduce the concept of conjugate acid-base pairs (pè konjige asid-baz) – when an acid donates H⁺, it becomes its conjugate base, etc. Highlight common properties of acids and bases: acids taste sour, bases bitter/soapy (with appropriate safety note: do not taste in lab!), acids turn blue litmus red, bases turn red litmus blue.
Key Concepts & Terms: Acid (Asid) – proton donor (donneur de proton) ; Base (Baz) – proton acceptor (accepteur de proton) . H⁺ ion – often exists as hydronium H₃O⁺ (iyòn idwonyòm) in water; OH⁻ (iyòn idroksid) – hydroxide ion. Conjugate base (baz konjige) – what an acid becomes after donating H⁺; Conjugate acid (asid konjige) – what a base becomes after accepting H⁺. Example: in reaction HA + H₂O → A⁻ + H₃O⁺, HA is an acid, A⁻ is its conjugate base.
Experiment Suggestion: Indicator Demo – Use litmus paper or a natural indicator like purple cabbage juice. Show that adding an acid (e.g. vinegar, HCl solution) turns cabbage juice pink/red, while a base (e.g. baking soda solution, NaOH) turns it green/blue. This visually reinforces the identification of acids vs bases. If possible, measure the conductivity: acids and bases in solution conduct electricity (they are electrolytes due to ions H⁺ or OH⁻).
Quiz/Activity: Have students classify substances as acid or base given their formula or description: e.g. H₂SO₄ (acid), Ca(OH)₂ (base), NH₃ (base in Brønsted sense), CH₃COOH (acid). Quiz question: “According to Brønsted-Lowry, what is the definition of an acid and a base?” (Answer: An acid is a proton (H⁺) donor, and a base is a proton acceptor ). Ask: “What are the conjugate acid and base in the reaction: NH₃ + H₂O ⇌ NH₄⁺ + OH⁻ ?” (Answer: NH₃ is a base, NH₄⁺ is its conjugate acid; H₂O is acting as an acid, OH⁻ is its conjugate base)."
Chemistry,NSIV,Unit 4: Acids and Bases (Reyaksyon Asid-Baz – Réactions Acide-Base),"Fos Asid ak Baz – Asid Fò vs Fèb, Baz Fò vs Fèb, ak Echèl pH","Learning Objectives: Differentiate between strong and weak acids and bases. Know that a strong acid (asid fò) dissociates ~100% in water to produce H⁺ (e.g. HCl, H₂SO₄), whereas a weak acid (asid fèb) only partially dissociates (e.g. acetic acid, CH₃COOH). Similarly, strong bases (like NaOH, KOH) dissociate completely to give OH⁻, while weak bases (like NH₃) only partially react with water. Introduce the idea of acid dissociation constant $K_a$ (and $K_b$ for bases) to quantify strength (without heavy math, just concept: larger $K_a$ means stronger acid). Explain the pH scale as a measure of acidity/basicity: pH < 7 acidic, pH = 7 neutral, pH > 7 basic. Show how pH relates to H⁺ concentration (log scale) in a qualitative way, and mention pH indicators.
Key Concepts & Terms: Strong acid (Asid fò) – almost fully ionizes in solution (e.g. HCl, yielding H⁺ + Cl⁻); Weak acid (Asid fèb) – partially ionizes (e.g. CH₃COOH, most molecules remain intact, only some give H⁺). Strong base (Baz fò) – fully dissociates into OH⁻ (e.g. NaOH); Weak base (Baz fèb) – partially accepts H⁺ (e.g. NH₃ + H₂O ⇌ NH₄⁺ + OH⁻). pH – a number scale (0–14 typically) indicating acidity; defined as pH = –log₁₀[H₃O⁺]. Neutral – [H₃O⁺] = [OH⁻], which is pH 7 at 25°C (for pure water). Possibly mention pOH (optional) or that pH + pOH = 14 (advanced, if needed).
Experiment Suggestion: pH Testing Lab (Virtual or Real) – Use pH paper or a pH meter to measure various household liquids: lemon juice or vinegar (acidic, low pH ~2-3), pure water (neutral, pH ~7), baking soda solution or mild soap (basic, pH ~8-9), and something strongly basic if available (like drain cleaner diluted NaOH – but handle with caution, only in teacher demo). Have students observe color changes on universal indicator paper or cabbage juice for each and assign approximate pH values.
Quiz/Activity: Provide a list of acids and bases and ask students to identify which are strong vs weak (for common ones, e.g. HCl – strong acid, HF – weak acid, NaOH – strong base, NH₃ – weak base). Quiz question: “Why is acetic acid (vinegar) considered a weak acid even though it is corrosive?” (Answer: It does not ionize completely in water – only a small fraction of CH₃COOH molecules donate H⁺ – but it’s still an acid and can be corrosive in concentrated form). Another question: “If the pH of a solution is 3, is it acidic or basic, and roughly what is the H⁺ concentration compared to a neutral pH 7 solution?” (Answer: pH 3 is acidic; its [H⁺] is 10,000 times higher than at pH 7, since each pH unit is a tenfold change). For practice, have them predict: “Will a 0.1 M solution of HCl have a higher or lower pH than a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid? Why?” (HCl will have a lower pH (more acidic) because it dissociates fully, yielding higher [H⁺] than the partial dissociation of acetic acid)."
Chemistry,NSIV,Unit 4: Acids and Bases (Reyaksyon Asid-Baz – Réactions Acide-Base),Reyaksyon Netralizasyon – Asid + Baz = Sèl + Dlo,"Learning Objectives: Illustrate what happens in an acid-base reaction, specifically neutralization between strong acids and bases. Teach that when an acid and base react, they form a salt (sèl) and water. For example: HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H₂O. Explain the ionic perspective: H₃O⁺ from the acid combines with OH⁻ from the base to form 2 H₂O molecules – this is why the solution’s acidic/basic properties are neutralized if mixed in proper proportions. Discuss the concept of titration as a method to determine an unknown concentration by neutralization (conceptual level). Also cover reactions of acids with metals (producing hydrogen gas) and with carbonates (producing CO₂) as additional important acid-base reactions in daily life.
Key Concepts & Terms: Neutralization (Netralizasyon) – reaction of acid and base to form neutral products (water and a salt); Salt (sèl) – ionic compound formed from the acid’s anion and base’s cation (e.g. NaCl, K₂SO₄). Titration (Titrasyon) – laboratory technique of gradual acid-base mixing to find the equivalence point (where moles acid = moles base, solution neutral). Equivalence point (pwen ekivalans) – point in titration where acid has completely reacted with base. Indicators (endikatè) – substances like phenolphthalein that change color at certain pH, used to detect endpoint of titration (phenolphthalein is colorless in acid, pink in base).
Experiment Suggestion: Neutralization in Action – Demonstrate a mini-titration: fill a flask with a known volume of dilute NaOH and a few drops of phenolphthalein (solution is pink in basic NaOH). Slowly add dilute HCl from a dropper while stirring. Students watch the pink color gradually fade and eventually disappear at the endpoint (solution becomes neutral/slightly acidic). This shows neutralization (formation of water and salt, no excess base so indicator turns colorless). Another simple demo: add baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) to vinegar – it bubbles (CO₂ gas from acid + carbonate reaction) and produces sodium acetate (a salt) and water.
Quiz/Activity: Quiz question: “Write the products and balance the equation: H₂SO₄ + 2 NaOH → ?” (Answer: Na₂SO₄ + 2 H₂O). Ask, “What volume of 0.1 M NaOH is needed to neutralize 20 mL of 0.1 M HCl?” (Answer: 20 mL, because it’s a 1:1 reaction, same molarity and volume needed). Also, have students predict outcomes: “When magnesium metal is dropped into hydrochloric acid, what gas is produced?” (Hydrogen gas, H₂, and MgCl₂ salt forms). Or “When an acid reacts with a carbonate compound, what are the products?” (A salt, CO₂ gas, and water). These reinforce common acid-base reactions beyond neutralization."
Chemistry,NSIV,Unit 4: Acids and Bases (Reyaksyon Asid-Baz – Réactions Acide-Base),Solisyon Tampon – Ki jan yo Estabilize pH,"Learning Objectives: Define a buffer solution (solisyon tampon) and understand its purpose: a buffer resists changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. Explain the composition of a typical buffer as a pair of a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid in solution. Describe qualitatively how a buffer works: e.g. acetic acid (weak acid) and sodium acetate (its conjugate base) – if you add acid (H⁺), the acetate ion will neutralize it; if you add base (OH⁻), the acetic acid will donate H⁺ to neutralize the base, thus maintaining pH. Mention examples of buffers in real systems (blood is buffered around pH 7.4, ocean water, etc.). Calculate pH of a buffer using Henderson-Hasselbalch formula for advanced understanding (optional, can be mentioned but not derived in detail).
Key Concepts & Terms: Buffer (Tampon) – a solution that maintains a relatively stable pH; Buffer capacity – how much acid/base can be absorbed before pH changes significantly. Henderson–Hasselbalch equation – $pH = pK_a + \log(\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]})$, relating pH to the ratio of conjugate base [A⁻] and acid [HA] (include for completeness, but focus on concept rather than calculation unless students are advanced). Common buffer pairs: acetic acid/acetate, carbonic acid/bicarbonate (in blood), etc.
Experiment Suggestion: Buffer Action Demo – Prepare two solutions: one is a buffer (e.g. mix equal parts of 0.1 M acetic acid and 0.1 M sodium acetate), the other is plain water or plain 0.1 M acetic acid. Measure and note their initial pH (buffer might be around pH 4.7 in this case, acetic acid alone maybe pH ~3). Now add a small amount of strong acid (a few drops of HCl) to each and measure pH again. The buffer’s pH will change only slightly, whereas the plain water or unbuffered acid’s pH will drop drastically. Similarly, try adding a few drops of NaOH to each and compare. This shows how the buffer “soaks up” the added acid or base.
Quiz/Activity: Quiz question: “What two components are needed to make a buffer solution?” (Answer: A weak acid and its conjugate base, or a weak base and its conjugate acid). Ask: “Why wouldn’t a strong acid and its conjugate base make a good buffer?” (Because a strong acid’s conjugate base is extremely weak and doesn’t significantly absorb H⁺, plus the strong acid fully dissociates, not leaving an equilibrium to resist change). As an activity, have students consider real-life importance: “Blood contains a bicarbonate buffer system. What could happen if our blood wasn’t buffered and we produced a lot of CO₂ (which forms carbonic acid) suddenly?” (It could lead to dangerous pH swings; buffering keeps pH in the narrow range necessary for life). Another question: Given the buffer pair H₂CO₃/HCO₃⁻, “write the equilibrium reaction showing how this buffer would neutralize added H⁺” (HCO₃⁻ + H⁺ → H₂CO₃), and “how it would neutralize added OH⁻” (H₂CO₃ + OH⁻ → HCO₃⁻ + H₂O)."
Chemistry,NSIV,Unit 5: Electrochemistry (Oksidorediksyon ak Elektwochimi),"Aplikasyon Elektwochimi – Batri, Kowozyon, ak Pwoteksyon","Learning Objectives: Summarize practical applications of electrochemistry, tying together galvanic and electrolytic concepts. Discuss batteries (pil) as galvanic cells – brief survey of common types (alkaline batteries, car lead-acid battery, lithium-ion rechargeable batteries) and how chemistry provides electrical power. Explain corrosion (rusting of iron) as an electrochemical process (iron oxidizes to Fe²⁺/Fe³⁺, oxygen is reduced to OH⁻ in presence of water) – essentially an undesirable galvanic cell with iron as anode. Introduce methods of corrosion prevention (painting, galvanization – coating iron with zinc which serves as sacrificial anode, or using sacrificial anodes like Mg blocks on ship hulls). Highlight one industrial electrochemical process: e.g. electrorefining of copper or production of chlorine and NaOH by brine electrolysis, to show how electrochemistry is crucial in industry.
Key Concepts & Terms: Battery (pil/batri) – a portable galvanic cell or series of cells providing electrical energy; Lead-acid battery (batri plon) – uses Pb/PbO₂ and H₂SO₄, producing about 2V per cell; Lithium-ion battery – a rechargeable cell where Li⁺ moves between anode/cathode (mention only conceptually). Corrosion (kowozyon) – deterioration of metals via electrochemical oxidation (rust is Fe₂O₃·xH₂O); Galvanization (galvanizasyon) – coating iron with zinc to prevent rust (zinc oxidizes preferentially). Sacrificial anode (anòd sakrifis) – a metal that is more easily oxidized (like Mg or Zn) attached to the protected metal, so it corrodes instead of the protected metal.
Experiment/Demo Suggestion: Corrosion Mini-Demo – Show two iron nails: one plain, one wrapped around with a more active metal like zinc or magnesium strip (or even connected to a piece of zinc). Place both in saltwater for a period (or show prepared results). The plain nail rusts, while the one in contact with zinc remains shiny (the zinc strip will corrode instead). This demonstrates sacrificial protection. Alternatively, demonstrate a simple voltaic pile: stack alternating layers of copper and zinc disks with paper soaked in vinegar between – it can produce a few volts; this is similar to historical batteries (Volta’s pile). Or show a small LED powered by a series of fruits (galvanic cells). These underscore how chemical energy converts to electrical and vice versa.
Quiz/Activity: Quiz question: “Why does coating iron with zinc protect it from rusting, even if the coating is scratched?” (Answer: Because zinc acts as a sacrificial anode – it oxidizes preferentially, protecting the iron by supplying electrons to it, thus preventing iron oxidation). Ask students to research one type of battery and report on the chemicals it uses and the reactions when it discharges. For example: “In a car battery (lead-acid), what material is the anode made of and what happens to it when the battery delivers current?” (Answer: Anode is lead metal (Pb); it gets oxidized to lead sulfate PbSO₄ as the battery discharges, while the cathode (PbO₂) is reduced to PbSO₄ as well). Another question: “Explain in electrochemical terms why saltwater speeds up corrosion of iron.” (Expected: Saltwater increases conductivity, allowing ions to carry current more readily; it effectively creates a better electrolyte for the iron/oxygen galvanic cell, accelerating the redox reactions that form rust)."
Chemistry,NSIV,Unit 5: Electrochemistry (Oksidorediksyon ak Elektwochimi),Balansman Ekwasyon Redox – Metòd Half-Reaction,"Learning Objectives: Learn how to balance redox reactions, especially in aqueous solutions, using the half-reaction method. Explain that balancing redox equations requires balancing both mass (atoms) and charge. Outline the steps: split the reaction into two half-reactions (oxidation and reduction), balance each for atoms and charge (adding H₂O, H⁺, and e⁻ in acidic solution; if basic solution, add OH⁻ as needed after balancing in acid), then scale and add the half-reactions back together, canceling electrons. Emphasize the need to specify the reaction medium (acidic or basic) because it dictates whether to use H⁺/H₂O or OH⁻/H₂O. Provide a simple example, like balancing the redox equation of permanganate and iron(II) in acidic solution: ${\text{MnO}_4^- + \text{Fe}^{2+} → \text{Mn}^{2+} + \text{Fe}^{3+}}$ (to illustrate the method).
Key Concepts & Terms: Half-reaction (mwatye reyaksyon) – either the oxidation part or reduction part of a full redox reaction, balanced separately ; Electron (elektron) – explicitly shown in half-reactions to balance charge. Acidic vs Basic conditions – in acid, balance O with H₂O and H with H⁺; in base, after doing acid steps, add OH⁻ to neutralize H⁺. Charge balance – total charge on reactant side equals total charge on product side for each half-reaction after adding electrons.
Experiment Suggestion: Rather than a physical experiment, this segment is more of a skill. Use a whiteboard demonstration or slides to show step-by-step balancing. You might use a real redox reaction from lab as the example: e.g. the dichromate and ethanol reaction (orange Cr₂O₇²⁻ becomes green Cr³⁺ in acid while ethanol oxidizes to acetic acid) or the simpler permanganate/iron II example mentioned. Work through balancing live, highlighting the addition of H₂O, H⁺, and e⁻. If in a classroom setting, have students practice with a different equation (like balancing the reaction of Zn metal with acid to produce H₂, or disproportionation of Cl₂ in water, etc.).
Quiz/Activity: Provide an unbalanced redox equation and ask students to practice balancing it using half-reactions. For instance: “Balance the redox reaction: ${\text{Zn} + \text{NO}_3^- → \text{Zn}^{2+} + \text{NO}_2}$ in acidic solution.” They should come up with: ${\text{Zn} + 4 H^+ + 2 \text{NO}_3^- → \text{Zn}^{2+} + 2 \text{NO}_2 + 2 H_2O}$ (one possible balanced form). Quiz question: “Why do we add H₂O and H⁺ when balancing redox reactions in acidic solution?” (Answer: To balance oxygen and hydrogen atoms – H₂O provides O and H, H⁺ provides additional H as needed – since H⁺ ions are available in acidic medium). Another question: “In basic solution, after balancing using H⁺ and H₂O, what extra step must you do?” (Answer: Add OH⁻ to both sides to neutralize H⁺ ions and form water, ensuring the final equation has no H⁺, then cancel extra water molecules)."
Chemistry,NSIV,Unit 5: Electrochemistry (Oksidorediksyon ak Elektwochimi),Elektwoliz – Reaksyon ki Pa Espontane kondwi pa Kouran (Batri Chajabl & Endistriyèl),"Learning Objectives: Explain electrolysis (elektwoliz), the process of using electrical energy to drive a non-spontaneous chemical reaction (essentially the opposite of a galvanic cell). Understand that in an electrolytic cell, the anode is still where oxidation occurs but is positive (connected to + of power supply) and cathode is negative (connected to – of supply) because we are pumping electrons into the cathode. Provide examples of electrolysis: splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen gas; electrolysis of molten sodium chloride to produce sodium metal and chlorine gas; electroplating metals. Discuss industrial importance (e.g. electrolysis of bauxite to aluminum metal, electrolysis in chlor-alkali process to produce chlorine and caustic soda). If applicable, mention rechargeable batteries: during charging, an external current effectively electrolyzes the battery’s chemistry to restore original reactants (this links galvanic and electrolytic concepts).
Key Concepts & Terms: Electrolysis (Elektwoliz) – using electricity to cause chemical change that wouldn’t spontaneously occur. Electrolytic cell (selil elektwolitik) – setup for electrolysis, typically with a power source driving the reaction. Anode (positif nan elektwoliz) – electrode connected to positive terminal, oxidation occurs (e.g. in water electrolysis, oxygen gas forms at anode from OH⁻ or H₂O); Cathode (negatif nan elektwoliz) – electrode connected to negative terminal, reduction occurs (e.g. hydrogen gas forms at cathode from H₂O in water electrolysis). Applications: Electroplating (galvanoplastie) – depositing a metal on an object by making the object the cathode in an electrolytic cell (e.g. silver-plating a spoon). Faraday’s laws (for advanced mention) – relate quantity of electricity to amount of substance produced (e.g. 1 Faraday ~ 96,500 C per mole e⁻).
Experiment/Demo Suggestion: Water Electrolysis Demo – Perform the electrolysis of water with a little sulfuric acid or baking soda added to increase conductivity. Use a 6V or 9V battery, two pencil graphite leads as electrodes in a beaker of the solution. Collect the gases in test tubes inverted over each electrode (classic Hofmann apparatus setup can be improvised). Show that twice as much gas (hydrogen) collects at the cathode (negative side) as oxygen at the anode, reflecting the reaction: 2 H₂O → 2 H₂ (at cathode) + O₂ (at anode). (Safety: ensure well-ventilated and no open flame nearby as hydrogen is flammable; disconnect when done.) This visually shows electrolysis in action.
Quiz/Activity: Quiz question: “During the electrolysis of molten NaCl, what forms at the cathode and what at the anode?” (Answer: Cathode – sodium metal (Na⁺ gains electrons to Na⁰); Anode – chlorine gas (Cl⁻ loses electrons to Cl₂ gas)). Ask: “Why is electrolysis of water considered a non-spontaneous reaction?” (Expected: because water does not decompose into H₂ and O₂ on its own; it requires energy input – ΔG is positive for the reaction, so we must supply electrical energy). For a quantitative challenge: “If 0.5 moles of electrons are passed through a copper(II) sulfate solution, how many moles of copper metal will deposit at the cathode?” (Answer: 0.25 moles, because Cu²⁺ + 2 e⁻ → Cu; two moles electrons produce one mole Cu). This connects charge to amount of substance. Another conceptual question: “What are some uses of electrolysis in daily life or industry?” (Possible answers: electroplating jewelry, producing aluminum, charging batteries, producing hydrogen fuel, etc., showing understanding of its broad utility)."
Chemistry,NSIV,Unit 5: Electrochemistry (Oksidorediksyon ak Elektwochimi),Oksidasyon ak Rediksyon – Konsèp Debaz Redox,"Learning Objectives: Introduce oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions, explaining that these are processes where electrons are transferred from one species to another. Define oxidation (oksidasyon) as the loss of electrons (or gain of oxygen in classical terms) and reduction (rediksyon) as the gain of electrons . Use the mnemonic “LEO says GER” (Lose Electrons Oxidation, Gain Electrons Reduction) or the French “OIL RIG” (Oxidation Is Loss, Reduction Is Gain). Identify that in any redox reaction, one substance is oxidized and another is reduced simultaneously. Explain what oxidizing agents and reducing agents are (the oxidizing agent gets reduced, the reducing agent gets oxidized ). Also introduce the concept of oxidation number (nombre d’oxydation) as a bookkeeping tool to track electron transfer, with basic rules (e.g. elements in elemental form have 0, etc.).
Key Concepts & Terms: Oxidation (Oksidasyon) – loss of e⁻, increase in oxidation state; Reduction (Rediksyon) – gain of e⁻, decrease in oxidation state. Oxidizing agent (ajan oksidan) – the substance that is reduced (accepts electrons) and thereby causes oxidation of another ; Reducing agent (ajan rediktè) – the substance that is oxidized (donates electrons) and causes reduction of another. Oxidation number (Nimewo oksidasyon) – a charge-like number assigned to atoms to help determine what is oxidized or reduced (e.g. in Fe²⁺ → Fe³⁺, Fe increases oxidation # from +2 to +3, it’s oxidized; if it goes +3 to +2, reduced).
Experiment Suggestion: Visual Redox Demo – Copper and Silver Nitrate: Place a clean piece of copper wire into silver nitrate solution. Over time, silver metal crystals deposit on the copper (the solution turns blue as Cu²⁺ forms). This is a spontaneous redox reaction: Cu metal is oxidized to Cu²⁺ (blue) and Ag⁺ is reduced to silver metal. Have students identify what is oxidized (Cu -> Cu²⁺) and what is reduced (Ag⁺ -> Ag). Alternatively, demonstrate zinc in copper sulfate: zinc metal becomes coated with copper, as Zn is oxidized to Zn²⁺ and Cu²⁺ is reduced to Cu solid (the solution fades from blue as Cu²⁺ is consumed).
Quiz/Activity: Practice assigning oxidation numbers to simple compounds (e.g. H₂O: H = +1, O = –2; NaCl: Na = +1, Cl = –1; Fe₂O₃: Fe = +3 each, O = –2). Quiz question: “In the reaction: Zn + 2 HCl → ZnCl₂ + H₂, which element is oxidized and which is reduced?” (Answer: Zn goes from 0 to +2 in ZnCl₂, so Zn is oxidized (reducing agent); H in HCl goes from +1 to 0 in H₂, so H⁺ is reduced (HCl acts as oxidizing agent)). Ask students to identify the oxidizing and reducing agents in that reaction (Oxidizing agent: HCl (or H⁺); Reducing agent: Zn metal). Another question: “What happens to the oxidation number of an element when it is oxidized? And when it is reduced?” (Answer: Oxidized -> oxidation # increases; Reduced -> oxidation # decreases)."
Chemistry,NSIV,Unit 5: Electrochemistry (Oksidorediksyon ak Elektwochimi),Pile Elektrochimik (Pil Galvanik) – Kijan yon Batri Pwodui Kouran,"Learning Objectives: Explain the structure and function of a galvanic/voltaic cell (pile elektrochimik) – a device that converts chemical energy from a spontaneous redox reaction into electrical energy . Describe the components: two half-cells (demi-pil), each with an electrode (an anode and a cathode) and an electrolyte solution. Clarify that oxidation occurs at the anode (anodo) and reduction at the cathode (katodo). Electrons flow through the external circuit from anode to cathode, and ions flow through a salt bridge (pon sèl) to maintain charge balance. Use the classic Daniel cell (Zn/Cu cell) as an example: Zn anode (Zn → Zn²⁺ + 2e⁻), Cu²⁺ cathode (Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu). Teach how to write cell notation (e.g. Zn | Zn²⁺ || Cu²⁺ | Cu). Mention cell voltage (voltage selil) or EMF and that it is determined by the difference in reduction potentials of the two electrodes.
Key Concepts & Terms: Anode (Anòd) – electrode where oxidation happens (electrons leave from here); Cathode (Katòd) – electrode where reduction happens (electrons enter here). Salt bridge (pon sèl) – a pathway for ions to migrate between half-cells, keeping the circuit neutral (e.g. a tube with salt solution or porous disk). Electrode potential (potansyèl elektwòd) – tendency of a given half-cell to gain or lose electrons (quantified as standard reduction potential E°); Cell voltage (tansyon pil) – measured in volts, positive for spontaneous cells. Line notation – shorthand describing a cell (solid|ion||ion|solid).
Experiment/Demo Suggestion: Build a Simple Battery – Demonstrate a lemon battery or potato battery: insert a zinc nail (anode) and a copper penny (cathode) into a lemon. Connect them with wires to a small LED or a voltmeter. The lemon’s citric acid acts as electrolyte; Zn is oxidized, Cu is reduced (actually oxygen in air is reduced at Cu in presence of the weak acid). While the voltage is small (~0.9 V), multiple lemons in series can light an LED dimly. Alternatively, show a pre-made Daniell cell: two beakers, one with Zn metal in ZnSO₄, another with Cu in CuSO₄, connected by a salt bridge (soaking paper in salt solution) and a wire with a small bulb or voltmeter. The bulb may not visibly light at low voltage, but a voltmeter will show ~1.1 V. This concretely shows how redox reactions create electric current.
Quiz/Activity: Quiz question: “In a Zn-Cu galvanic cell, which electrode is the anode and which is the cathode? Which direction do electrons flow?” (Answer: Zn is the anode (oxidation of Zn to Zn²⁺), Cu is the cathode (reduction of Cu²⁺ to Cu); electrons flow from Zn electrode through the wire to the Cu electrode). Ask: “What is the purpose of the salt bridge in a galvanic cell?” (Answer: to allow ionic flow that neutralizes charge buildup, completing the circuit). Have students label a diagram of a galvanic cell with anode, cathode, direction of electron and ion flow. Another question: “Given two half-reactions with standard potentials, how do you predict the cell voltage and which will be the anode vs cathode?” (Answer: the half-reaction with lower (more negative) reduction potential will act as anode (get oxidized), the one with higher reduction potential is cathode; cell voltage E° = E°(cathode) – E°(anode)). This could be an enrichment for advanced learners."
Chemistry,NSIV,"Unit 6: Organic Chemistry (Chimi Òganik – Konpoze Kabòn: Idrokarbur, Fonksyon Òganik, ak Polimè)",Entwodiksyon a Chimi Òganik – Enpòtans Kabòn,"Learning Objectives: Introduce organic chemistry as the chemistry of carbon compounds (konpoze kabòn). Explain what makes carbon special: tetravalency (4 bonding sites), ability to form stable chains and rings, and bonds with many elements (notably H, O, N, halogens). Emphasize the sheer variety of organic compounds, from biomolecules to plastics, and thus why organic chemistry is a major branch. Clarify that organic compounds range from simple (methane, CH₄) to very complex (DNA, polymers) and include things integral to life and industry. Outline the basic types of formulas: molecular formula, structural formula, and the idea of bonding (covalent bonds) in organic molecules.
Key Concepts & Terms: Organic compound (konpoze òganik) – a compound primarily made of carbon and hydrogen, often with O, N, etc.; Hydrocarbon (idrokarbur) – simplest class containing only carbon and hydrogen; Catenation – carbon’s ability to form long chains; Tetravalent (tetravalans) – having a valence of 4 (carbon forms 4 covalent bonds). Mention that historically “organic” meant from living organisms, but now it includes synthetic compounds (the term is defined by composition and structure). Examples: methane (CH₄), ethanol (alkòl etilik, C₂H₅OH), etc. Possibly touch on bonding: single, double, triple bonds that carbon can form.
Experiment Suggestion: Molecule Modeling Activity – Use a molecular model kit or improvised models (marshmallows and toothpicks or ball-and-stick kits) to build small organic molecules: have students construct a methane (CH₄) model, an ethane (C₂H₆) chain, perhaps an ethene (C₂H₄) with a double bond, and benzene ring (C₆H₆). This hands-on visualization helps them see carbon’s tetravalence and bonding geometry. Alternatively, show images or a computer model of a few simple organic molecules in 3D.
Quiz/Activity: Quiz question: “Why can carbon form so many different compounds? Name two reasons.” (Answer: Because it can form four covalent bonds allowing chain/ring structures, and it can bond to itself (catenate) and other elements in many ways). Ask: “What elements are commonly found in organic compounds besides carbon and hydrogen?” (Possible answers: oxygen, nitrogen, halogens like chlorine, sulfur, phosphorus in some, etc.). Activity: have students draw structural formulas for a given molecular formula, e.g. C₂H₆O (two possibilities: ethanol and dimethyl ether) to introduce that there can be more than one structure for a formula – leading into isomerism in the next video."
Chemistry,NSIV,"Unit 6: Organic Chemistry (Chimi Òganik – Konpoze Kabòn: Idrokarbur, Fonksyon Òganik, ak Polimè)","Estrikti ak Izomeri – Fòmil Estriktirèl, Izomè Konstitisyonèl ak Espasyal","Learning Objectives: Learn how organic compounds are represented and the concept of structural formulas. Understand what isomers (izomè) are: compounds with the same molecular formula but different arrangements of atoms. Differentiate between constitutional (structural) isomers (izomè konstitisyonèl) – different connectivity of atoms – and stereoisomers (izomè espasyal) – same connectivity but different spatial arrangement (like cis/trans or optical isomers). Provide simple examples: C₄H₁₀ (butane vs isobutane are structural isomers); C₂H₂Cl₂ (cis-1,2-dichloroethene vs trans-1,2-dichloroethene are cis-trans geometric isomers). Introduce terminology: straight-chain vs branched structures. Emphasize the importance of isomerism in properties of compounds (e.g. one isomer may boil at a different temperature or have different reactivity).
Key Concepts & Terms: Structural formula (fòmil estriktirèl) – drawing that shows how atoms are bonded in a molecule (e.g. H–O–H for water, or CH₃–CH₂–OH for ethanol). Condensed formula – e.g. CH₃CH₂OH, a shorthand; Line-angle formula – zigzag lines where vertices are carbon atoms (advanced notation, but could show briefly). Isomer (izomè) – same formula, different structure. Constitutional isomer – differ in connectivity (atoms attached differently); Stereoisomer – same connectivity, different orientation in space. Cis-trans isomers (izomè sis/trans) – occur in compounds with double bonds or rings where rotation is restricted (cis = substituents on same side, trans = opposite sides). Chirality (kiryalite) – mention enantiomers (mirror-image isomers) if relevant (e.g. left and right hand molecules, important in biochemistry/pharmacology), but at least note that some molecules can have non-superimposable mirror images.
Experiment Suggestion: Modeling Isomers – Using molecular models or even drawing, have students build or sketch isomers. For example, give them C₅H₁₂ and ask how many different structures (isomers) they can make (pentane has 3 isomers). Use models to show cis vs trans: e.g. model but-2-ene and fix the double bond, then attach two identical groups on each carbon, rearrange to show cis and trans. If available, use a pair of gloves or 3D objects to explain chirality (left vs right hand analogy for enantiomers).
Quiz/Activity: Quiz question: “What’s the difference between butane and isobutane in terms of structure and formula?” (Answer: Both are C₄H₁₀, but butane is a straight chain CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃, while isobutane (methylpropane) is branched CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH₃; they are structural isomers). Show two structures and ask if they are isomers or the same compound. For stereoisomers: present formulas for cis- and trans-2-butene, ask which one likely has a higher boiling point (cis usually due to polar forces). A conceptual question: “Why do isomers matter in biological systems?” (Expected: Different isomers can have dramatically different effects; e.g. one enantiomer of a drug may be effective, the other inactive or harmful – as in thalidomide case – demonstrating importance of 3D arrangement)."
Chemistry,NSIV,"Unit 6: Organic Chemistry (Chimi Òganik – Konpoze Kabòn: Idrokarbur, Fonksyon Òganik, ak Polimè)","Fanmi Idrokarbur – Alkan, Alkèn, Alkyn, ak Aromatik","Learning Objectives: Classify hydrocarbons into their families and understand their general properties. Cover: Alkanes (Alkan) – hydrocarbons with only single bonds, formula CₙH₂ₙ₊₂ for acyclic alkanes, generally unreactive (saturated hydrocarbons) except for combustion and substitution; Alkenes (Alkèn) – hydrocarbons with at least one C=C double bond, formula CₙH₂ₙ (unsaturated), more reactive (undergo addition reactions); Alkynes (Alkin) – hydrocarbons with at least one triple bond, formula CₙH₂ₙ₋₂, also unsaturated and reactive; Aromatic hydrocarbons (Aren) – e.g. benzene and its derivatives, with special stable ring structure and formula like C₆H₆ for benzene (unsaturated but does not behave like normal alkenes due to resonance stabilization). Show examples: methane (CH₄, simplest alkane), ethene (C₂H₄, simplest alkene), ethyne/acetylene (C₂H₂, simplest alkyne), benzene (C₆H₆). Explain what saturated vs unsaturated means (saturated = maximum H, no double bonds; unsaturated = can add H, has double/triple bonds). Mention physical state differences: lower alkanes are gases, middle are liquids (like gasoline range), higher are solids (waxes). Also mention naming basics: alkane names (methane, ethane, propane, etc.), alkene names (ethylene is common for ethene, but-1-ene, etc.), just to familiarize with terminology without requiring full mastery.
Key Concepts & Terms: Alkane (Alkan) – single bonds only, saturated; Alkene (Alkèn) – contains C=C double bond; Alkyne (Alkin) – contains C≡C triple bond; Aromatic (Aromatik) – contains a benzene-like ring (delocalized pi electrons). Saturated (sature) – no multiple C–C bonds; Unsaturated (ensature) – has double or triple bonds. General formulas: CₙH₂ₙ₊₂ for acyclic alkanes; CₙH₂ₙ for one double bond (alkene); CₙH₂ₙ₋₂ for one triple bond (alkyne). Benzene ring (noyau benzèn) – a hexagonal ring of carbons with alternating double bonds (often drawn as a circle to indicate resonance).
Experiment Suggestion: Hydrocarbon Properties Demo – Show a few simple experiments to distinguish properties: e.g. Combustion test – burn a small amount of an alkane (paraffin oil or candle wax vapor) vs an aromatic (toluene) – aromatics give a sooty flame (due to higher carbon content and aromatic ring stability) whereas alkanes give a cleaner flame. Bromine test for unsaturation: Add a drop of bromine solution (Br₂ in dichloromethane, brown) to an alkane (e.g. hexane) vs an alkene (cyclohexene) in separate test tubes. The alkene will quickly decolorize the bromine (adding Br₂ across the double bond), whereas the alkane will not (brown color persists) without UV light. (Safety: bromine is hazardous; this could be shown as a video or teacher demo with caution.) This demonstrates the higher reactivity of unsaturated hydrocarbons.
Quiz/Activity: Quiz question: “What is the difference between an alkane and an alkene in terms of bonds and hydrogen content?” (Answer: Alkane has all single C–C bonds and is saturated with hydrogens (CₙH₂ₙ₊₂); Alkene has at least one C=C double bond and is unsaturated (fewer hydrogens, CₙH₂ₙ).) Ask: “Name the following hydrocarbon: CH₃-CH₂-CH=CH₂.” (Answer: 1-butene, an alkene). Or “Which is more reactive generally, an alkane or an alkene, and why?” (Answer: an alkene, because the double bond can react (add to reagents) – the π bond is more reactive). Another question: “Benzene (C₆H₆) doesn’t readily undergo addition reactions like other unsaturated compounds. What special feature does it have?” (Answer: aromatic stability – a delocalized ring of electrons that makes it unusually stable; it tends to undergo substitution rather than addition). As a short activity, have students draw the structures of propane (C₃H₈), propene (C₃H₆) and propyne (C₃H₄) to ensure they can visualize the single, double, triple bond differences."
Chemistry,NSIV,"Unit 6: Organic Chemistry (Chimi Òganik – Konpoze Kabòn: Idrokarbur, Fonksyon Òganik, ak Polimè)",Reaktivite Alkan – Substitisyon Radikalè (Eg: Alkan + Klò),"Learning Objectives: Explore the chemical reactivity of alkanes, which is generally low due to strong C–C and C–H single bonds. Learn that the primary reaction type for alkanes is substitution (substitisyon) under energetic conditions (like UV light) – a classic example is the free-radical halogenation of alkanes (e.g. methane + chlorine gas in UV yields chloromethane and HCl). Explain the mechanism in simple terms: UV light splits Cl₂ into radicals; Cl· attacks an alkane, extracting H and forming HCl and an alkyl radical; the alkyl radical reacts with another Cl₂ to form the chlorinated product and another Cl· (chain reaction). Mention that this leads to mixtures (multiple hydrogens can be substituted). Discuss combustion of alkanes as another key reaction (complete combustion yields CO₂ and H₂O, incomplete can yield CO). Emphasize that alkanes are useful as fuels precisely because they are stable enough to handle but release energy when combusted. Also mention cracking (breaking long alkanes to smaller ones + alkenes) in petroleum refining, illustrating another reaction (though more industrial).
Key Concepts & Terms: Free radical (radikal lib) – a species with an unpaired electron, extremely reactive; Halogenation – reaction of alkanes with halogens (Cl₂, Br₂) to substitute H with halogen (requires heat/UV). Substitution reaction (reyaksyon substitisyon) – one atom/group in a molecule is replaced by another (here H replaced by Cl). Combustion (konbisyon) – reaction with O₂ producing CO₂, H₂O (and heat); Complete vs incomplete combustion – incomplete yields carbon monoxide (CO) or soot (C). Reactivity order in radical halogenation: tertiary C–H > secondary > primary (due to stability of intermediates), though this may be a finer detail to mention.
Experiment Suggestion: Halogenation Demo (if feasible) – Demonstrate the reaction of bromine with an alkane vs alkene (continuing from earlier test): If you shine a UV lamp on the alkane + bromine mixture from the prior test, after some time the color will fade and HBr will form (can be detected by its fumes or turning blue litmus red). This shows that alkanes can react under UV (forming bromoalkane and HBr), albeit slowly compared to immediate alkene addition. A safer demonstration: show burning of a lighter fuel (butane) – a mostly clean flame – to illustrate alkane combustion. You can also demonstrate the production of CO₂ and H₂O by collecting combustion gases and bubbling through limewater (Ca(OH)₂) to turn it cloudy (CO₂ test) and seeing condensation (water) on a cool surface.
Quiz/Activity: Quiz question: “What products are formed when butane (C₄H₁₀) undergoes complete combustion?” (Answer: carbon dioxide and water: 2 C₄H₁₀ + 13 O₂ → 8 CO₂ + 10 H₂O). Ask: “Why do alkanes generally require heat or light to react with halogens?” (Because alkanes are quite inert; significant energy is needed to initiate the radical chain reaction by breaking bonds). “In the chlorination of methane, what is the role of UV light?” (It provides energy to homolytically cleave Cl₂ into Cl radicals, initiating the chain reaction). For a thought exercise: “Octane is a component of gasoline. Why is it beneficial that octane is relatively unreactive at room temperature, yet combusts readily in an engine?” (Because stability allows safe storage and handling, but under ignition conditions it releases lots of energy – a good fuel)."
Chemistry,NSIV,"Unit 6: Organic Chemistry (Chimi Òganik – Konpoze Kabòn: Idrokarbur, Fonksyon Òganik, ak Polimè)",Reaktivite Alkèn ak Alkin – Adisyon sou Liyzon Doub/Trèb,"Learning Objectives: Understand that alkenes and alkynes, unlike alkanes, readily undergo addition reactions (reyaksyon adisyon) across their multiple bonds. Explain that in addition, the π bond is broken and new atoms add to the carbons. Common reactions for alkenes: Hydrogenation (adding H₂ across C=C to give an alkane, usually with a metal catalyst), Halogenation (adding X₂, e.g. Br₂, across the double bond, as seen with the bromine test), Hydrohalogenation (adding HX, e.g. HBr, giving alkyl halides), Hydration (adding H₂O in presence of acid catalyst to form alcohols). Introduce Markovnikov’s rule: in asymmetric alkene additions (like H–Br adding to C=C), the H attaches to the carbon with more hydrogens (rich get richer), and the X (Br) attaches to the carbon with more alkyl substituents – this is due to carbocation intermediate stability (this concept can be mentioned simply). Note that alkynes undergo similar additions (two equivalents can add to fully saturate to alkane, or controlled to alkene stage). Also mention that alkenes can polymerize by addition (this will be expanded in polymer video). Highlight that aromatic arenes do not undergo simple addition because that would disrupt the stable aromatic system; they preferentially undergo substitution (as will be detailed separately).
Key Concepts & Terms: Addition reaction (reyaksyon adisyon) – two atoms/groups add across a double or triple bond, yielding a saturated (or less unsaturated) product. Hydrogenation (idwojènasyon) – H₂ addition (e.g. turning vegetable oil (with C=C) into margarine (more saturated)); Halogenation – X₂ addition (Br₂ test result, adds to give dihalides); Hydration – H₂O addition (often via H⁺ catalyst) yielding alcohol. Markovnikov’s rule (Règ Markovnikov) – “who gets the H?” rule for unsymmetrical additions; Polymerization (polymerizasyon) of alkenes – an important reaction where many alkene molecules add in a chain (to be covered later).
Experiment Suggestion: Addition Reaction Demo – Already partially covered by bromine test. Could demonstrate hydrogenation conceptually by referencing how unsaturated oils are hydrogenated to make solids (no simple classroom demo due to need for catalyst and H₂ gas). Instead, perform a KMnO₄ test (Baeyer test) for unsaturation: Alkenes react with cold dilute potassium permanganate (purple) and get oxidized, resulting in brown MnO₂ precipitate – a test for double bonds. For example, add a purple KMnO₄ solution to cyclohexene vs cyclohexane: cyclohexene will turn brown (diol formation and MnO₂), cyclohexane stays purple. (Safety: KMnO₄ can stain, handle carefully). This shows addition (actually oxidation) across double bond.
Quiz/Activity: Quiz question: “When ethene (C₂H₄) is reacted with bromine (Br₂), what is the product?” (Answer: 1,2-dibromoethane, C₂H₄Br₂). “What about ethene with HCl?” (Answer: chloroethane, C₂H₅Cl, following Markovnikov – here symmetric so no issue). Ask them to predict the product of adding water to propene (CH₃-CH=CH₂) with acid catalyst (Answer: 2-propanol, CH₃-CHOH-CH₃, Markovnikov addition so -OH goes to middle carbon). Another question: “Why do we need a metal catalyst (like Pt or Ni) to hydrogenate an alkene with H₂ gas?” (Answer: H₂ is not reactive on its own at low temperatures; the catalyst surface helps break H–H bonds and attach H atoms to the double bond). As an activity, show the structure of an unsymmetrical alkene (e.g. 1-butene) and ask students to apply Markovnikov’s rule for HBr addition (product: 2-bromobutane predominantly). Also, foreshadow polymer topic: “What happens if ethene molecules undergo addition with each other repeatedly?” (They form polyethylene, a long chain – a polymer – to be discussed soon)."
Chemistry,NSIV,"Unit 6: Organic Chemistry (Chimi Òganik – Konpoze Kabòn: Idrokarbur, Fonksyon Òganik, ak Polimè)",Reaktivite Idrokarbur Aromatik – Substitisyon Elektwofil (Eg: Benzèn),"Learning Objectives: Explain that aromatic hydrocarbons (like benzene, C₆H₆) have a special stability due to their ring of π electrons (resonance). Because of this, they do not react like typical alkenes (they resist addition which would break the aromatic system). Instead, they undergo electrophilic substitution reactions: an electrophile replaces one of the hydrogen atoms on the aromatic ring, preserving the aromatic core. Describe a common example: nitration of benzene (with a mixture of HNO₃ and H₂SO₄, benzene gets a –NO₂ substituent, forming nitrobenzene) or halogenation of benzene (with FeBr₃ catalyst, benzene + Br₂ gives bromobenzene + HBr). Mention other electrophilic substitutions like sulfonation (adding –SO₃H) or Friedel–Crafts alkylation (adding an alkyl group with AlCl₃ catalyst). Emphasize that these reactions require catalysts/strong conditions, reflecting benzene’s stability. Also point out the concept of the aromatic ring as nucleophile attacking electrophiles. Introduce that substituents on the ring can direct further substitution (activating or deactivating ring, ortho/para or meta directors), though details can be minimal at this level. The key is: aromatic = substitution, not addition (to preserve the ring).
Key Concepts & Terms: Aromatic stability (estabilite aromatik) – extra stability of benzene ring due to delocalized electrons; Electrophile (elektwofìl) – an electron-seeking species (e.g. NO₂⁺ in nitration, Br⁺ in bromination) that attacks the electron-rich benzene ring; Electrophilic aromatic substitution (substitisyon elektwofil aromatik) – reaction where an electrophile replaces a hydrogen on the aromatic ring. Examples: nitration (with nitronium ion NO₂⁺ generated from HNO₃/H₂SO₄), halogenation (with Br⁺ or Cl⁺ generated by FeBr₃ or FeCl₃ catalyst), etc. Resonance (rezonans) – concept explaining how benzene’s electrons are delocalized, usually depicted with a circle or alternating double bonds. Ortho, meta, para – relative positions on ring (if advanced, mention that certain groups direct to ortho/para or meta positions in further substitutions).
Experiment Suggestion: Direct aromatic substitution might be hard to demo in a simple class setting due to harsh reagents. Instead, show an everyday example of an aromatic compound reaction: perhaps burn a sample of an aromatic compound (like mothball – naphthalene) to show the sooty flame indicating aromatic presence. Alternatively, the bromination of phenol in water produces a precipitate (2,4,6-tribromophenol, white solid, and bromine water decolorizes) – but phenol is activated, not benzene itself. This could show aromatic substitution in an activated ring. For benzene, likely better to use a video clip or describe industrial nitration (TNT comes from nitration of toluene for example) to illustrate importance.
Quiz/Activity: Quiz question: “Why doesn’t benzene readily undergo addition of Br₂ like cyclohexene does?” (Answer: Adding Br₂ to benzene would disrupt its aromatic stability; benzene prefers to keep its ring intact and will undergo substitution instead of addition). “What type of catalyst is needed to brominate benzene, and what is its role?” (Answer: A Lewis acid like FeBr₃; it polarizes Br₂ to generate a Br⁺ electrophile that can attack the benzene ring). Ask: “Name the products when benzene is nitrated with a mixture of nitric and sulfuric acid.” (Nitrobenzene (C₆H₅NO₂) and water). As an activity, show a benzene ring with one substituent (like toluene, C"

Math,NSI,Unit 1: Arithmetic (Aritmetik),"Ekspresyon Literè ak Faktorizasyon Debaz – Using algebraic symbols in arithmetic, simplifying expressions, and simple factorization of numeric expressions (e.g. using produits remarquables like (a+b)2)  .","Learning Objectives:
Recognize different types of numbers (par egzanp: nonm antye, rasyonèl, irasyonèl – integers, rational, irrational) and locate them on a number line .
Master the four basic operations in ℝ and apply their properties (pwopriyete komitatif, asosyatif, distribitif).
Evaluate expressions mentally using special products and identify opportunities to factor numeric expressions .
Use absolute value (valè absoli) to describe distance and order relationships among real numbers.
Approximate and bracket (encadre) a number or calculation between two bounds (e.g. knowing 3<√10<4) and understand rounding/estimation for real-life calculations.
Key Concepts and Techniques:
Set of Real Numbers (Ensemble ℝ): All rational and irrational numbers. Students learn Haitian Creole terms for each subset and how they form the continuum of the number line . They practice placing numbers (like –2, 3/4, √2) on a line and using interval notation (e.g. [–1, 2[ for –1 ≤ x < 2).
Operations and Properties: Review addition, soustraction, miltiplikasyon, divizyon with positives and negatives. Emphasize properties: e.g. a + b = b + a (komitatif), (a·b)·c = a·(b·c) (asosyatif). Demonstrate distributivity with numeric examples: a(b+c) = ab + ac. Use mental math tricks: e.g. calculating 1012 by expansion (100+1)2 = 1002 + 2·100·1 + 12 = 10 201 .
Literal Expressions & Basic Factorization: Introduce using letters to represent numbers in formulas (e.g. understanding that the identity (a+b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2 applies to any numbers a, b). Show simple factorization like factoring out a common factor (e.g. 15 + 9 = 3(5 + 3)). This bridges to algebraic thinking while staying in a numeric context .
Absolute Value and Order: Define |a| as distans ant a ak zewo. Show examples: |–5| = 5. Explain that for any real numbers a and b, |a| ≥ 0 and |a| = 0 if and only if a = 0. Use absolute value in comparing numbers (e.g. which of –7 or 5 is “larger” on the number line?). Relate absolute value to practical contexts (distance, magnitude).
Comparisons and Encadrement: Teach techniques to give an encadrement (bound) of a number or sum. For example, estimate √50 by noting 72 =49 and 82 =64, so √50 ≈7.07 (bounded between 7 and 8). Practice rounding results of operations and using “≈” for approximations.
Example Problems & Practice:
Egzanp 1: Klase nimewo sa yo de pi piti ale nan pi gran: –3, 5/2, –2.7, √9, 0. (Ans: –3 < –2.7 < 0 < 5/2 = 2.5 < √9 = 3**)
Egzanp 2: Konvèti ekspresyon 4(7 + 3) – 22 nan fòm ki pi senp. (HInt: aplike distribitivite epi kalkile)
Egzanp 3: Siyen vre oswa fo: |–8| – |5| = |–8 – 5|. (Antisipe elèv idantifye sa a fo, epi eksplike poukisa: 8 – 5 ≠ |–13|)
Egzanp 4: Fè yon encadrement pou √65. (Repons egzak: 82=64 ≤ 65 < 81=92, kidonk 8 ≤ √65 < 9.)
Practice suggestions: Identify 5 real numbers that lie between 2 and 3; Simplify expressions like (–4) + 7 – (–3); Find two different pairs of integers (a, b) such that |a| = |b|. Students should explain their reasoning in Kreyòl to build communication skills in math.
Mini-Quiz/Review Ideas:
Vre/Fò Quiz: Quick true/false statements to check understanding of definitions and properties. Egzanp: “0 se yon nonm rasyonèl” (Vre/Fò?) ; “|–5| = –5” (Vre/Fò?) ; “Si a > b, alò –a < –b” (Vre/Fò?).
Matching Game: Match numbers to their description (e.g. –√2 ↔ irasyonèl negatif, 3/4 ↔ rasyonèl,  √9 ↔ antye pozitif). This reinforces number categories.
Quick Calculation Drill: Timed practice where students compute mental math examples (like 99 × 101) using special products or estimate a complicated expression by bracketing it.
Interactive Number Line: Teacher calls out a number (e.g. –2.5 or √5) and students place it on a physical number line or indicate which interval it falls in. This can be a group activity to review ordering and estimation.

Interpret a ratio (rapò) and identify proportional relationships in tables or situations (if one quantity doubles, the other doubles, etc.).
Solve for an unknown term in a proportional relationship (the “quatrième proportionnelle” or fourth term of a proportion) using cross-multiplication .
Convert between fractions, decimals, and percentages (pousantaj) fluently (e.g. 0.75 = 75%).
Apply percentage formulas to real-life scenarios: calculate discounts, interest, tax, and percentage change (ogmantasyon/diminisyon an pousan).
Recognize proportionality in real-world problems (map scaling, mixture of ingredients, speed = distance/time) and solve these problems systematically.
Key Concepts and Techniques:
Definition of Proportion: Introduce “pwopòsyon” as an equation of two ratios (e.g. a/b = c/d). Use visual examples like “3 mango costs $2, so 6 mango costs $4” to illustrate equal ratios. Emphasize if a/b = c/d, then ad = bc (cross-multiplication law). Students practice solving for an unknown in statements like  $\frac{x}{4} = \frac{9}{12}$.
Equivalent Fractions and Scaling: Show how scaling up/down preserves a ratio. Use tables (“tablo pwopòsyon”) to find missing values. For example, a recipe uses 2 cups of rice for 5 people; how much for 8 people? Construct a ratio table to find the answer (≃3.2 cups).
Fourth Proportional: Explain “katriyèm pwopòsyonèl” as the fourth term x in a proportion when three terms are known. For instance, to find x in $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{x}$, we solve x = (b·c)/a . Provide straightforward examples (e.g. “If 5 books cost $20, how much do 8 books cost?”).
Percentages: Define 1% as one part per 100. Teach conversion: to find p% of a quantity, multiply by p/100. Work through examples: 20% of 150 (which is 0.2 × 150 = 30), or finding what percent one number is of another. Illustrate increase/decrease: e.g. Ogmantasyon de 5% means new value = 1.05 × old value . Relate to proportions: “5% increase” is like for each 100, add 5.
Real-Life Applications: Use real currency and local context for percent problems (e.g. sales tax on an item in gourdes, a 10% discount on a phone plan, or population growth rates). For mixture problems, perhaps use Haitian market examples: mixing rice of two prices per kg – what’s the average price? Emphasize setting up proportional equations or reasoning with parts. Encourage reasoning in kreyòl for understanding."

Math,NSI,Unit 2: Algebra (Aljèb),"Aplikasyon Sistèm nan Pwoblèm – Setting up and solving simple word problems using 2-variable linear systems (e.g. mixture, money, or intersection problems).","Learning Objectives:
Solve a pair of simultaneous linear equations in two unknowns using algebraic methods: sostisyon (substitution) and eliminasyon (elimination) .
Identify the number of solutions of a linear system: one solution (lines intersect), none (parallel lines, no intersection), or infinitely many (coincident lines) and understand the criteria in equations (different or proportional coefficients).
Graphically represent linear systems: draw each equation’s line on the Cartesian plane and find their intersection point, verifying it matches the algebraic solution.
Solve systems of linear inequalities in two variables by graphing each inequality and finding the overlapping region (understand basic idea of a feasible region).
Translate real-world situations into systems of equations (for example, finding two numbers given their sum and difference, or solving mixture problems with two unknown quantities) and interpret the solution in context .
Key Concepts and Techniques:
Substitution Method: Outline steps: solve one equation for one variable, substitute into the other equation, solve for the single variable, then back-substitute. For example, from $\begin{cases} x + y = 10 \ 2x - y = 4 \end{cases}$, solve first for y: $y = 10 - x$, substitute into second: $2x - (10 - x) = 4$ → $3x - 10 = 4$ → $3x = 14$ → $x = \frac{14}{3}$, then $y = \frac{16}{3}$. This gives solution $(x, y) = (\frac{14}{3}, \frac{16}{3})$. (Also mention many solutions will come out integer in nice problems, but fractions are fine too.)
Elimination Method: Teach aligning equations and adding/subtracting to eliminate one variable. For example, for $\begin{cases} 3a + 2b = 7 \  a - 2b = 1 \end{cases}$, adding equations directly eliminates b (because $2b + (-2b) = 0$), yielding $4a = 8$, so $a = 2$, then back-substitute to find $b$. Emphasize multiplying one or both equations by constants if needed to align coefficients (e.g. multiply one equation by –1 to eliminate a variable).
Graphical Interpretation: Draw coordinate axes (aks absis (x) ak òdone (y)) and sketch each line from the system. Show that the solution is where the two lines meet (pwen entèseksyon an). Use an example: $x + y = 6$ and $x - y = 2$. Graph both (which are straight lines), find intersection at $(4,2)$. Reinforce checking: plug into both equations. Discuss special cases: if lines are parallel (e.g. $y = 2x + 1$ and $y = 2x - 5$) -> no solution; if the same line (e.g. equations are multiples) -> infinitely many solutions (all points on that line) .
Systems of Inequalities: Introduce by simple case: $y > x$ and $y \le 4$. Graph $y = x$ (dotted line for >) and shade above it, graph $y = 4$ (solid line for ≤) shade below it. The overlapping shaded region (above one line, below the other) is the solution set for the system. Emphasize interpreting an ordered pair being a solution if it satisfies both inequalities. This topic can remain exploratory if time is short, focusing on understanding rather than heavy computation.
Problem Solving with Systems: Show how some problems naturally yield two equations. For example: “Suma de dwa chif se 15, diferans yo se 3. Jwenn chif yo.” (x + y = 15, x - y = 3, solve x=9, y=6). Or a money problem: “Yon timoun gen pyès 5 Goud ak pyès 1 Goud totalize 20 pyès ki vo 50 Goud. Konbyen pyès 5 Goud li genyen?” (system: number of coins: $f + o = 20$, value: $5f + 1o = 50$, solve). Encourage writing equations in Creole as they derive them, then solving. Solutions should be stated in full sentences (to link math back to language).
Example Problems & Practice:
Egzanp 1: Rezoud sistèm sa a: $\begin{cases} 2x + y = 11 \ 3x - y = 4 \end{cases}$. (Adding equations: $5x = 15$ → $x = 3$, then $23 + y = 11$ → $y = 5$. Solution: $(3,5)$.)*
Egzanp 2: Rezoud pa eliminasyon: $\begin{cases} 5m + 2n = 1 \ 3m + 2n = 7 \end{cases}$. (Subtract second from first: $(5m-3m) + (2n-2n) = 1 - 7$ → $2m = -6$ → $m = -3$. Back-sub: $3(-3) + 2n = 7$ → $-9 + 2n = 7$ → $2n = 16$ → $n = 8$. Solution: $(-3, 8)$.)
Egzanp 3: Okenn oswa Infini? Rezoud: $\begin{cases} 4x - 2y = 6 \ -2x + y = -3 \end{cases}$. (Notice second eq is -1/2 of first? Multiply second eq by -2: $4x - 2y = 6$ which is identical to first. So infinitely many solutions – every point on that line. Describe solution set as ${(x,y):4x-2y=6}$ or parametric, e.g. $x=t, y=2x-3$.)
Egzanp 4: Sitiye grafikman: $\begin{cases} x + 2y = 4 \ x - 2y = 0 \end{cases}$. (Solve algebraically for check: adding gives $2x = 4$ so $x=2$, then $2y=2$ so $y=1$. Plot both lines: first line passes (0,2) and (4,0); second passes (0,0) and (2,1) – they intersect at (2,1).)
Egzanp 5: Inekwasyon: Lonje rejyon solisyon pou $\begin{cases} y \ge  -x + 1 \ y < 2 \end{cases}$ sou yon grafik. (Graph $y = -x + 1$ (solid line, shade above) and $y = 2$ (dotted horizontal line at y=2, shade below). The overlap is the region between these lines, above the first, below the second.)
Egzanp 6: Pwoblèm: “Nan yon kafe, yo melanje de kalite pwa diferan pou fè yon melanj 100 kg. Premye kalite a koute 60 G/kg, dezyèm nan 80 G/kg. Si pri mwayen melanj la se 70 G/kg, konbyen kilo chak kalite pwa yo itilize?” (System: $x + y = 100$; $60x + 80y = 70*100$. Solve: from first, $y=100-x$. Substitute: $60x + 80(100-x) = 7000$ → $60x + 8000 - 80x = 7000$ → $-20x = -1000$ → $x = 50$, $y = 50$. So 50 kg of each.)
Practice suggestions: Mix of solving systems using preferred method and checking. Provide one word problem requiring a system (students write equations and solve). Have students practice both substitution and elimination on the same system to see both in action. For graphing practice, give systems to solve graphically (possibly ones with neat integer solutions) and have students draw them on graph paper. For inequalities, you might restrict practice to one inequality at a time first (graph region for a single linear inequality), then try a system of two. Emphasize interpreting a point in the feasible region vs outside (test points to check).
Mini-Quiz/Review Ideas:
Method Pick: Give a system and ask students which method (substitution or elimination) seems easier and why – then solve it. For example, $\begin{cases} y = 2x + 1 \ 3x + y = 7 \end{cases}$ clearly invites substitution (with $y$ already expressed). This checks understanding of strategy selection.
Solve & Check: A quick quiz: solve a given system and also plug the solution back into both original equations to verify (this ensures they remember the check step).
Graphical Quickie: Show a graph of two lines intersecting or parallel, etc., and ask how many solutions the system has. Or show a pair of equations and ask if the lines are parallel or intersecting without solving (by comparing slopes). E.g. Are lines $y=2x+1$ and $2y=4x+5$ parallel? (Yes, both have slope 2).
Inégalité Bingo: If covering systems of inequalities, play a “bingo” style game where teacher describes a region (e.g. “x > 0, y > 0” the first quadrant) and students identify the corresponding system of inequalities, or vice versa. For simpler review, do a single inequality version where students are given an inequality and must quickly sketch a boundary line and shading on mini whiteboards.
Application question (short): Present a mini-scenario and have students set up the system (equations only, no solving) as a quick check on formulation skills. For example: “The sum of two numbers is 20. Twice the first minus the second is 8. What system of equations represents this?” (Answer: $x+y=20$, $2x - y = 8$).

Recognize the equation of a line in slope-intercept form y = mx + c (or y = ax + b as previously) and identify its slope m and y-intercept c at a glance .
Determine the x-intercept (where y=0) and y-intercept (where x=0) of a line from its equation, and use these to sketch the line quickly .
Calculate the slope of a line given two known points on it using the formula $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$. Understand that parallel lines have equal slopes, and perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals (m1 * m2 = -1 for perpendicular) .
Recognize when two equations represent the same line (multiples) or parallel lines (proportional coefficients for x and y but different constant) or perpendicular lines (slopes product -1) .
Convert a linear equation from general form (e.g. 2x + 3y - 6 = 0) to slope-intercept form, and vice versa, to best extract needed information. Use these skills to solve geometric problems (e.g. find equation of line through given points, or line parallel/perpendicular to another passing through a given point).
Key Concepts and Techniques:
Slope-Intercept Form: Reiterate that in $y = mx + c$, m is the pente (slope) and c is the ordinate at origin (y-intercept). Provide examples: if line equation is $y = -2x + 5$, slope = -2, y-intercept = 5 (so passes (0,5)). If line is given as $2x + y = 4$, solve for y: $y = -2x + 4$ to identify slope = -2, intercept = 4. Show that the intercepts are easily read when in this form.
Finding Intercepts: Teach setting x=0 to find y-int, and y=0 to find x-int. For example, $3x + 2y = 12$: y-int when x=0 → $2y=12$ so y=6 (point (0,6)); x-int when y=0 → $3x=12$ so x=4 (point (4,0)). Plot these to draw the line. This is a quick graphing method.
Slope Calculation: Take two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), plug into slope formula. Emphasize consistent order (difference in y over difference in x). Show an example: points (1,2) and (4, 8) yield slope $(8-2)/(4-1) = 6/3 = 2$. If slope is positive line rises, if negative line falls. Use diagram to illustrate slope visually.
Parallel & Perpendicular: State: Lines are parallel (paralèl) if they have same slope (and different intercepts) . If slopes differ, lines eventually intersect. Perpendicular (pèpandikilè) lines in a plane have slopes that multiply to -1 (e.g. 2 and -0.5). Provide a quick test: line1: $y = 3x + 1$, line2: $y = 3x - 4$ are parallel (m=3 both); line3: $y = -\frac{1}{3}x + 2$ is perpendicular to those (since $3 * -\frac{1}{3} = -1$). Also mention vertical and horizontal lines as special cases: e.g. $x = k$ (vertical, undefined slope) perpendicular to any horizontal $y = c$ (zero slope).
General Form (Ax + By + C = 0): Explain sometimes line equations are given in this form. Show how to rearrange to slope-intercept: solve for y. E.g. $2x + 5y - 10 = 0$ → $5y = -2x + 10$ → $y = -\frac{2}{5}x + 2$. Now slope -2/5, intercept 2. Conversely, starting with slope form, multiply through to avoid fraction slopes if needed (especially in proofs or standard form contexts).
Using Line Equations in Problem Solving: e.g. find equation of line through (2,3) with slope 4 (point-slope form usage: $y - 3 = 4(x - 2)$ → convert to slope-intercept). Or find line through two points: find slope then find equation by substitution. Solve simple geometric problems: given one line’s equation, find equation of line parallel or perpendicular to it through a certain point. These skills tie algebra to geometry nicely.
Example Problems & Practice:
Egzanp 1: Pou liy $y = 5x - 3$, bay koefisyan direksyon ak entèsepsyon y a. (m = 5, c = –3.) Ki kote liy sa a koupe aks $x$ la? (Set y=0: $0 = 5x - 3$ → $5x = 3$ → $x = 0.6$. So x-intercept = 0.6.)
Egzanp 2: Ekrib kout (rewrite) $3x - 4y + 8 = 0$ nan fòm $y = mx + c$, epi li koòdone entèsepsyon yo. (Solve: $-4y = -3x - 8$ → $y = \frac{3}{4}x + 2$. So y-int (0,2), x-int: set y=0 → $\frac{3}{4}x + 2 = 0$ → $x = -\frac{8}{3}$, so (−2.67, 0).)
Egzanp 3: Kalkile pant dwat ki pase pa pwen A(–1, 2) ak B(3, 5). (Slope $m = (5-2)/(3-(-1)) = 3/4$.) Epi jwenn yon ekwasyon pou dwat AB la. (Use point-slope: $y - 2 = \frac{3}{4}(x - (-1))$, simplify to $y = \frac{3}{4}x + \frac{11}{4}$.)
Egzanp 4: Liy L1: $y = -2x + 7$. Liy L2: $2y = -x + 4$. Eske liy sa yo paralèl, pèpandikilè, oswa ni youn ni lòt? (L1 slope = -2; L2: rewrite as $y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 2$, slope = -1/2. The product $-2 * -1/2 = 1$, not -1, so not perpendicular; and slopes are not equal, so not parallel. They will intersect but not at a right angle.)
Egzanp 5: Jwenn ekwasyon liy ki paralèl ak $y = 3x - 5$ ki pase nan pwen (0, 4). (Parallel means same slope m=3, so form $y = 3x + b$. Use (0,4): 4 = 30 + b → b=4. Equation: $y = 3x + 4$.)*
Egzanp 6: Chalenge: Yon liy pèpandikilè ak $y = \frac{2}{3}x + 1$ pase pa pwen (2, –1). Jwenn ekwasyon li. (Slope of given = 2/3, perpendicular slope = -3/2. Use point-slope: $y + 1 = -\frac{3}{2}(x - 2)$ → $y + 1 = -\frac{3}{2}x + 3$ → $y = -\frac{3}{2}x + 2$.)
Practice suggestions: Provide equations for students to practice extracting slope and intercept quickly. Also, give pairs of equations and have them decide parallel/perpendicular/neither. Graphing practice: give an equation in general form and have them plot via intercepts, and one in slope form to plot via slope point method, to compare efficiency. For slope calculation, supply coordinates of endpoints of various line segments (some with negative slopes, zero slope, undefined slope) for students to compute slopes. They should also practice writing line equations: e.g. “Find the equation of the line through (–1,4) parallel to  y = –½x + 7”. Another exercise: provide a line’s graph drawn on grid paper and ask students to deduce its equation (by reading intercepts or two points). For creative practice, ask students to sketch a line that satisfies certain conditions (like “positive slope, passes between these points, etc.”) and then verify by finding its equation.
Mini-Quiz/Review Ideas:
Intercept Quiz: List equations and have students quickly jot the intercepts for each. For example: $y = 2x + 6$ (y-int 6, x-int –3); $x + 2y = 8$ (x-int 8, y-int 4); $y = -3x$ (y-int 0, x-int 0). Fast recall of concept.
Slope Match: Provide a list of slopes and a list of line pairs, ask which pair corresponds to which slope relationship. E.g. Slopes: equal, negative reciprocal, etc. Pairs: (a) $y=4x+1$ & $y=4x-5$; (b) $y=½x$ & $y=-2x+3$; (c) $y=-3x$ & $y=\frac{1}{3}x+7$. Students match: (a) equal slopes (parallel), (b) negative reciprocals (perpendicular, since 0.5 * -2 = -1), (c) -3 * 1/3 = -1 (also perpendicular!).
Equation Relay: One student computes slope from two points, passes result; next student uses that slope and one point to write equation; third checks by plugging second point. This reinforces multi-step problem solving for line equations as a team game.
Transform the Equation: Give a line equation in general form and ask students to rewrite it as y=mx+c in one minute (to test algebraic manipulation agility). Or vice versa: given y= form, rewrite in Ax+By+C=0 with integer A, B, C (multiply out denominators if any).
Conceptual Check: Ask: “If two distinct lines have the equations $ax + by + c = 0$ and $ax + by + d = 0$ (with c≠d), what is their relationship?” (Expected: parallel, since left sides share same a, b slope part, different constant means shifted parallel lines .) Or “Line p is perpendicular to q. If slope of q is 4/3, what is slope of p?” (Answer: -3/4). Quick conceptual questions confirm understanding.

Polynomial Vocabulary: Define a monòm as an expression of the form $ax^n$ (with a single term). For example, $5x^2$ is a monomial with coefficient 5 and degree 2. A polinòm is a sum of monomials; e.g. $3x^2 - 2x + 7$ (tri-nomial). Introduce terms: koefisyan (coefficient), eksponan/degre (exponent/degree), tèm konstant (constant term). Provide examples in Creole: egzanp: “$4x^3$ gen koefisyan 4 ak degre 3.”
Addition and Subtraction: Emphasize like terms (tèm similè) – terms with the same variable power. Show how to combine them: e.g. $3x^2 + 5x^2 = 8x^2$. Work through subtracting polynomials as adding the opposite: $(5x^2 - 3x + 1) - (2x^2 - x) = 3x^2 - 2x + 1$. Encourage writing polynomials in standard form (highest degree first).
Multiplication (Polynôm × Polynôm): Demonstrate distributive property with polynomials (every term times every term). For instance: $(2x + 3)(x - 4) = 2x^2 - 8x + 3x - 12 = 2x^2 - 5x - 12$. Mention special products in algebraic form: $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ and $(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$, linking to earlier arithmetic usage .
Basic Factoring: Start with factoring out the gwo kofaktè komen (greatest common factor) from terms, e.g. $6x^2 + 9x = 3x(2x + 3)$. Then cover recognizable patterns: difference of squares $a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)$. Try simple trinomial factoring: e.g. $x^2 + 5x + 6 = (x+2)(x+3)$. Keep to “simple configurations” as per the syllabus  – i.e., integer roots. Encourage checking by re-expanding.
Rational Expressions: Explain that a rational expression is like a fraction but with polynomials. Give an example: $\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1}$. Simplify by factoring numerator: $\frac{(x-1)(x+1)}{x-1}$ and cancel $(x-1)$ to get $x+1$, but with domain restriction $x \neq 1$ (since the original denominator zero at 1) . Emphasize writing domain: e.g. $f(x) = \frac{2x}{x-3}$ has $x \neq 3$. This introduces the concept of function domain in a concrete way.
Use of Symbols: Reinforce meaning of algebraic symbolism in Creole context (like reading $3x^2$ as “twa fwa x kare”). This builds comfort in transitioning from numeric to algebraic manipulation.
Example Problems & Practice:
Egzanp 1: Idantifye degre ak koefisyan prensipal polinòm sa a: $-7x^3 + 4x - 5$. (Degree 3, leading coefficient -7).
Egzanp 2: Sèmplifye: $(3x^2 + 2x - 1) + (x^2 - 5x + 4)$. (Combine like terms: $4x^2 - 3x + 3$.)
Egzanp 3: Kalkile: $(2x - 3)(x + 5)$. (Answer: $2x^2 + 10x - 3x - 15 = 2x^2 + 7x - 15$.)
Egzanp 4: Faktorize ekspresyon yo: (a) $4y^2 - 9$; (b) $x^2 + 6x + 8$. (Answers: (a) $(2y - 3)(2y + 3)$; (b) $(x+2)(x+4)$.)
Egzanp 5: Senplifye fraksyon aljebrik la: $\frac{x^2 - 5x + 6}{x - 2}$. (Factor numerator = $(x-2)(x-3)$, cancel $(x-2)$, result $x-3$, domain $x \neq 2$.)
Egzanp 6: Domèn: Pou ki vale $x$ ekspresyon $\frac{3x}{x^2 - x}$ pa defini? (Set denominator $x(x-1) = 0$, so $x = 0$ or $x = 1$ excluded.)
Practice suggestions: Provide a list of polynomials for students to classify by degree and term count (monomial, binomial, etc.). Drill addition/subtraction with alignment of like terms. Have students multiply a binomial by a trinomial (e.g. $(x+2)(x^2 - x + 3)$) and maybe two general trinomials for challenge. For factoring, give a mix of easy cases and ask students to check solutions by multiplying factors. For rational expressions, practice identifying when cancellation is valid and stressing the domain: e.g. simplify $\frac{x^2-4}{2x-4}$ and state restriction ($x \neq 2$). Encourage explaining steps in Creole (e.g. “Mwen remake $x^2-4$ se yon diferans de kare, kidonk mwen faktorize li an $(x-2)(x+2)$…”).
Mini-Quiz/Review Ideas:
Vocabulary Check: A short matching quiz where students match Creole terms to definitions or examples. For instance, “monòm” with “yon egzanp se $5x^3$”, “tèm konstant” with “egzanp: 7 nan $3x + 7$”.
Quick Simplify Round: On the board or in a worksheet, a set of small tasks: add two polynomials, multiply two binomials, factor one expression, and simplify one rational expression. This can be timed (e.g. 5–10 minutes) to see how much they recall quickly.
Error Spotting: Present a worked solution with mistakes (e.g. a wrong distribution or cancellation like cancelling $x$ in $\frac{x}{x+1}$). Have students identify and correct the errors. For example: “$\frac{x^2-1}{x-1} = \frac{\cancel{x-1}(x+1)}{\cancel{x-1}} = x+1,$ even for $x=1$.” Students should catch the error that $x=1$ is not allowed and explain it.
Factoring Relay: In groups, students are given different expressions to factor. One student factors, another checks by multiplying, then they pass to next expression. This encourages teamwork and reinforces factor-multiply relationships.
Domain Quick Question: Give 3–4 rational expressions and have students quickly write the domain of each (e.g. $\frac{1}{x+4}$, $\frac{x}{x}$, $\frac{x+1}{x^2-1}$). They should answer in set notation or by stating “all real except …”. This quickly tests their understanding of undefined values.

Understand the concept of a function as a rule that assigns to each input x exactly one output f(x). Use proper function notation (f(x), read “f de x”) and understand x ↦ ax notation .
Recognize a linear function (through origin) of the form f(x) = a·x and know it represents direct proportionality. Identify its graph as a straight line through (0,0) with slope a (for each 1 unit increase in x, f(x) increases by a units).
Understand an affine function of the form f(x) = ax + b. Interpret the parameters: a is the slope (koefisyan direksyon or pente) and b is the y-intercept (ordonnee a l’orijin). Understand how changing a or b affects the line’s steepness and position .
Be able to compute images and antecedents: given x, find f(x); given f(x) (output), solve f(x) = k to find the corresponding x  .
Recognize real-world phenomena that can be modeled by linear or affine functions (currency exchange rate, temperature conversion, simple linear depreciation, etc.) and formulate the function rule from data or description.
Key Concepts and Techniques:
Definition of Function: Explain in Creole: “Yon fonksyon se yon règ ki bay yon rezilta (y) pou chak vale antre (x).” Use everyday example: f could be a “price function” where f(n) gives cost for n items. Emphasize uniqueness: each x has one f(x). Introduce the notation f: x ↦ … as seen in French sources .
Linear Functions (Direct Proportionality): Form f(x) = a x. Show that f(0) = 0 always. If a = 2, then f(x) double x (e.g. price is 2 gourdes per unit). Graph passes through origin. Present multiple representations: formula, table of values, and graph. Show that doubling x doubles f(x) (characteristic of proportional relationships) . Example: f(x) = 5x could represent “5 goud per mango”; f(3) = 15 (goud for 3 mangoes).
Slope (Coefficient Directeur): Define slope a as $\frac{\Delta f(x)}{\Delta x}$ (rate of change). If f(x)=a x, then a = f(1) (the output for x=1). If a = 3, line goes up 3 units for each 1 across. Use a graphical triangle to illustrate slope. In Haitian Creole, one might say “pente a montre konbe f(x) ogmante lè x ogmante de 1.” Relate to angle: a larger slope means a steeper line.
Affine Functions: Form f(x) = a x + b. Discuss how b shifts the line up/down (b is the value of f at x=0). Graph f(x) = 2x + 3: even if x=0, f(0)=3 (point (0,3) on graph). Compare with f(x)=2x (which went through (0,0)). Emphasize that these lines are parallel to f(x)=2x but shifted . Mention that any affine function graph is a line, not necessarily through origin.
Function Graph Reading: Practice picking an x value and finding the corresponding point on the line to get f(x). And conversely, given a horizontal line at f(x)=k, find where the line intersects to get the x that yields that output . For example, if f(x)=3x+6, find x if f(x)=12 (set 3x+6=12, solve x=2). Use graph to confirm.
Variation and Real Examples: Show how linear functions model proportional situations: e.g. converting Haitian gourdes to US dollars is f(g) = g * 0.01 (if 1 G = $0.01), an example of direct proportion. For affine, an example: Celsius to Fahrenheit: F = 1.8C + 32 (not through origin, intercept 32). Use this to illustrate an affine function from real life. Also connect slope to concepts like speed (if distance vs time graph: slope = speed). Highlight percentage increase as multiplication: “augmenter de 5%” corresponds to f(x) = 1.05 x  (affine if there’s also a base amount plus increase in absolute terms). These reinforce how the abstract function translates to practical formulas.
Example Problems & Practice:
Egzanp 1: Si $f(x) = 4x - 1$, kalkile $f(0)$, $f(2)$, ak $x$ pou ki $f(x) = 7$. (Answers: $f(0)=-1$ (y-intercept); $f(2)=7$; solve $4x-1=7$ → $4x=8$ → $x=2$.)
Egzanp 2: Fonksyon $g(x) = 5x$. Fè yon tablo ki montre $x$ ak $g(x)$ pou $x = 0, 1, 2, 3$, epi trase liy lan. Ki rapò ou obsève ant ogmantasyon $x$ yo ak ogmantasyon $g(x)$ yo? (Students fill: $g(0)=0, g(1)=5, g(2)=10, …$; graph passes origin; observe $Δg = 5 * Δx$.)
Egzanp 3: Yon graf liy dwat pase pa pwen (0, -2) ak (3, 4). Jwenn fonksyon afìn li a nan fòm $f(x) = ax + b$. (First find slope: $(4 - (-2))/(3 - 0) = 6/3 = 2$. So a=2, then use point to find b: $-2 = 20 + b$, so $b=-2$. Function: $f(x) = 2x - 2$.)*
Egzanp 4: Entèpretasyon: Si $h(x) = -\frac{1}{2}x + 5$, ki valè $h(x)$ lè $x = 6$? Ak pou ki $x$ $h(x) = 0$? (Compute $h(6) = -3 + 5 = 2$; solve $-\frac12 x + 5 = 0$ → $-\frac12 x = -5$ → $x = 10$.)
Egzanp 5: Aplikasyon: Yon konpayi taksi itilize fòmil $C(d) = 50 + 30d$ (an goud) pou kalkile pri, kote $d$ se distans an km. (50 G se pri fikse, 30 G/km se pri pou chak kilomèt). a) Konbyen pou 0 km? (50 G base fee) b) Konbyen pou 10 km? (50+300=350 G) c) Si yon kliyan peye 200 G, konbyen km li fè? (Set 50+30d=200 → 30d=150 → d=5 km.)
Egzanp 6: Konvèsyon: Fòmil pou konvèti degre Sèlsiyis (°C) an degre Farenayt (°F) se $F(C) = 1.8C + 32$. Reponn: a) Ki siyifikasyon “32” nan fòmil la? (It’s F when C=0, freezing point offset). b) Si dlo bouyi a 100°C, kalkile tanperati a an °F. (F(100) = 212°F.) c) Si yon jou li fè 68°F, ki tanperati sa an °C? (Solve 68 = 1.8C+32 → 1.8C=36 → C=20°C.)
Practice suggestions: Give students a set of linear function formulas and have them identify slope and intercept quickly. Practice converting a linear relationship described in words to a function formula (e.g. “a salary is 5000 base gourdes plus 200 gourdes per hour of work” → f(h) = 200h + 5000). Have them create tables of values for a couple of functions to solidify the idea of constant rate of change. Use graph exercises: given a graph of a line, determine its equation by identifying two points. Conversely, graph given functions on the same axes to compare slopes and intercepts (e.g. f(x)=2x, g(x)=2x+3, h(x)=-2x+3, etc.). To reinforce notation, ask questions like: “If f(x) = 3x - 4, what is f(a + 2)?” to see if they can substitute expressions (result: 3(a+2)-4). This deepens understanding of function as a machine.
Mini-Quiz/Review Ideas:
Flash Identify: Project or write a few function definitions (like f(x)= -3x + 1, g(x) = 0.5x, h(x)=5) and ask quick questions: “Which are linear vs affine?” “Which has the greatest slope?” “Which passes through origin?” for immediate responses.
Slope/Intercept quiz: Provide small graphs of lines and ask students to write the equation quickly for each. Or list equations and have them state slope and intercept of each without graphing.
Table to Equation: Give a table of input-output pairs for a linear function (e.g. x:0,1,2; f(x):2,5,8) and ask to find the formula. (In example, slope =3, intercept=2, so f(x)=3x+2.) This checks understanding of linear pattern recognition.
Fill in the blanks: Write a linear function formula with blanks: “f(x) = __ x + __” and give conditions to fill them: e.g. “slope is -4 and f(0)=5” (answer: f(x) = -4x + 5).
Real-life Q&A: As a quick oral or written quiz, ask something like: “A car rental costs 1000 G + 20 G per km. Write the cost function C(k).” or “If a spring lengthens by 2 cm per 100g added, and its natural length is 10 cm, write length = f(weight) function.” These test ability to translate to affine functions on the spot and interpret parameters.

Solve linear equations of the form ax + b = c (and equations requiring simplification, like with parentheses or variables both sides) using inverse operations and balancing.
Solve linear inequalities (e.g. 3x - 5 < 7) and represent the solution set on a number line, using interval notation and respecting the direction of inequality when multiplying/dividing by negatives  .
Understand solution types: unique solution, no solution (contradiction), infinite solutions (identity). Recognize when an equation simplifies to a tautology (e.g. 0=0) or impossibility (e.g. 5=0).
Check solutions by substitution and interpret the result in context (e.g. if x represents an amount, verify that it satisfies the original conditions of a word problem).
Apply linear equations and inequalities to solve simple real-life problems (age, money, distance, comparisons) and validate the answers.
Key Concepts and Techniques:
Solving Equations: Emphasize the balance method (what you do to one side, do to the other). Walk through examples: solve  5x + 7 = 22 by subtracting 7 (both sides) then dividing by 5. Also handle cases like 3x - 4 = 2x + 5 (bring like terms together). Use straightforward language: “Retire 2x sou toude bò yo” to mean subtract 2x from both sides. Illustrate with a practical scenario (e.g. “If 5x+7 is total cost after adding tax of 7 gourdes, equal to 22, find x the pre-tax cost”).
Properties of Equality and Inequality: Outline that adding or subtracting the same quantity keeps an inequality true; multiplying or dividing by a negative number flips the inequality sign . Example: from –2x < 6, dividing by –2 (negative) gives x > –3. Provide multiple examples to build this reflex.
Graphing Solutions: After solving an inequality (like x > –3 or 2 ≤ x < 5), show how to graph it on the liy nimewo: use open/closed circles (ti wonn vid oubyen plen) and arrows for direction. Reinforce interval notation alongside: x > –3 corresponds to (–3, ∞).
Equation Solution Types: Demonstrate special cases: if variables cancel and a true statement remains (e.g. 0=0), it means all real numbers are solutions (tout R). If a false statement remains (e.g. 3=0), then no solution (pa gen solisyon). For instance, solve 2(x - 1) = 2x - 2: it simplifies to $2x - 2 = 2x - 2$ then $0 = 0$ (identity). Contrast with 2x + 3 = 2x - 5: simplifies to $3 = -5$ (no solution).
Checking Solutions: Always plug the found solution back into the original equation to verify. If solving a word problem, interpret the solution to see if it makes sense (e.g. a negative answer for an age problem indicates something went wrong in modeling or extraneous root).
Simple Applications: Set up linear equations from word problems: e.g. “Yon papa gen 3 fwa laj pitit li a; ansanm laj yo fè 48 an. Jwenn laj pitit la.” (Translate to: p = child’s age, 3p = father’s age, p + 3p = 48, so 4p=48, p=12). Similarly, use inequalities: e.g. “Pou pase egzamen an ou bezwen ≥ 60 pwen; si ou gen 45 pwen kounye a, konbyen pwen minimòm ou ta dwe genyen nan dezyèm pati a (sou 100)?” leads to inequality 45 + x ≥ 60 → x ≥ 15. These illustrate real uses.
Example Problems & Practice:
Egzanp 1: Rezoud ekwasyon sa a: $4x + 9 = 3x - 5$. (Bring 3x: $4x - 3x + 9 = -5$ → $x + 9 = -5$ → $x = -14$.)
Egzanp 2: Rezoud ekwasyon: $7(2y - 1) - 5 = 3(4y + 2)$. (Expand: $14y - 7 - 5 = 12y + 6$ → $14y - 12y - 12 = 6$ → $2y - 12 = 6$ → $2y = 18$ → $y = 9$.)
Egzanp 3: Rezoud ineksyon: $5 - 2t < 3$. (Subtract 5: $-2t < -2$ → divide by -2 (flip sign): $t > 1$.)
Egzanp 4: Rezoud ineksyon: $3x + 4 ≥ 10x - 9$. (Bring $3x$: $4 + 9 ≥ 10x - 3x$ → $13 ≥ 7x$ → dividing by positive 7: $13/7 ≥ x$, or $x \le 13/7$.) Represent on number line and interval: $(-∞,; \frac{13}{7}]$.
Egzanp 5: Solisyon espesyal: Rezoud: $2(3z + 1) = 6z + 5$. (LHS expands to $6z + 2$, equation becomes $6z+2 = 6z+5$ → $2 = 5$, impossible ⇒ ø no solution.)
Egzanp 6: Pwoblèm: “Yon melanj genyen de kantite ki vo egal a 100. Premye kantite la se $x$, dezyèm nan se $2x + 10$. Si yo vo egal, ki ekwasyon sa bay e ki valè $x$?” (Set $x = 2x+10$ for equality, solve $x - 2x = 10$ → $-x = 10$ → $x = -10$. It yields a negative, which might indicate a setup issue or interpretation: good discussion point.)
Practice suggestions: Solve a set of linear equations, including some requiring simplification (parentheses, fractions like $\frac{2}{3}x + 1 = x - 5$). Include at least one identity and one contradiction for students to identify. For inequalities, provide some to solve and graph, e.g. $-3 < 2x + 1 \le 5$. Have students write a brief sentence interpreting an inequality solution (e.g. $x \ge 4$ means any number 4 or greater is allowed). Word problems: create simple linear models (number puzzles, age problems, comparisons) for students to translate into equations. They should practice writing let-statements in Haitian Creole: “Se pou nou asime kantite liv yo se y…”, then equation, solve, and answer in a full sentence.
Mini-Quiz/Review Ideas:
One-Minute Equations: Put 2 basic equations on the board and give students one minute to solve both. Quick check ensures they remember the procedures.
Inequality True/False: List a few inequalities with a suggested solution, students mark if the solution is correct. Eg: “x + 3 < 7; solution given: x < 4” (True), “–2x > 8; solution given: x > –4” (False, should flip to x < –4). This tests the crucial flipping rule.
Mix and Match: Provide a mix of equations and inequalities on small slips of paper and a set of solutions. Students must match each problem to its correct solution or solution set (for inequalities).
Graph It!: Hand out a couple of solved inequalities (like $x > -2$ or $x \le 5$) and have students graph them on mini-whiteboards or paper quickly. Alternatively, show a graphed solution on a line and ask them to write the corresponding inequality.
Word Problem Quickie: A short word problem is given (like “I am thinking of a number: twice it plus 3 equals 11. What is the number?”). Students write the equation and solve it as a mini challenge. This checks their ability to translate words to equations on the fly.

Master circle-related vocabulary in Haitian Creole (with French equivalents): e.g. sant (centre), reyon (rayon), dyamèt (diamètre), kawo (circonférence), ak (arc), ang an sant (angle au centre), ang enskri (angle inscrit).
Understand and articulate the Inscribed Angle Theorem: an angle formed by two chords meeting on the circle (inscribed angle) is half the measure of the central angle spanning the same arc . Symbolically, if ∠ABC is inscribed, and Arc ADC is the arc it intercepts, then ∠ABC = ½ ∠AOC, where O is center.
Solve problems using inscribed angles: find missing angle measures when multiple inscribed angles subtend the same arc (they are equal), or when inscribed angles subtend arcs of known central angles .
Recognize special cases: an angle inscribed in a semicircle (subtending a diameter) is 90° (Thales’ circle theorem) . Use this to identify right angles in circle diagrams.
Apply circle angle properties to related problems: find angles in cyclic quadrilaterals (understand opposite angles in a circle sum to 180° as a consequence of inscribed angles), and compute interior angles of regular polygons using central angles.
Key Concepts and Techniques:
Circle Basics: Quick review that a circle (sèk) is set of points equidistant from center. Show how an ang an sant is formed at the center by two radii, whereas an ang enskri is formed on the circumference by two chords. Use a diagram to label these. Explain arc – portion of the circle’s edge between two points. (Arc in Creole likely just “ark” or “bò sèk”. Possibly mention French term arc.)
Inscribed vs Central Angle Theorem: Demonstrate with a figure: Draw circle center O, points A, B, C on circumference, where AOC is central angle and ABC inscribed angle intercepting arc AC. Measure (or use known theorem) that ∠ABC = ½ ∠AOC . Provide a numeric example: if ∠AOC = 80°, then ∠ABC = 40°. If ∠ABC is given, central angle is double. This is a critical property to memorize and use.
Angles subtending Same Arc: If ∠ABC and ∠ADC intercept the same arc AC from different points B and D on the circle, then ∠ABC = ∠ADC (they see the same arc) . This leads to conclusions like: in a cyclic quadrilateral (4 points on a circle), angle A + angle C = 180° (since each pair intercepts the arc between the other pair). Mention this as a useful derived fact: opposite angles of a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle sum to 180°.
Right Angle in Semicircle (Thales’ Theorem): If an inscribed angle subtends a diameter (arc is 180°), then the angle is 90° . Explain: diameter corresponds to central angle 180°, half is 90°, so any angle across a diameter is right. So any triangle inscribed in a circle with one side as diameter is a right triangle (angle at the circumference opposite the diameter = 90°). Do a quick proof or demonstration to cement this idea.
Applications: Show how to find unknown angles in complex circle diagrams: For example, given one central angle or inscribed angle, find others by relationships. Use algebra if needed: e.g. if one inscribed angle is (2x)° and another intercepting same arc is (x+10)°, set 2x = x+10 to solve for x.
Regular Polygons and Circle Angles: Extend concept: In a regular n-gon inscribed in a circle, each central angle = 360°/n. The inscribed angle that subtends one side (same arc as central angle) will be half that (180°/n). For example, in a square inscribed in a circle, central angle =90°, inscribed angle at each vertex =45°, consistent with a square’s interior angle being 90° (actually each vertex angle is formed by two inscribed angles from arcs spanning two sides, but we can discuss if time). This shows interplay between polygon interior and circle theorems, which can enrich understanding (though not required by minimal syllabus, it’s an application).
Example Problems & Practice:

Egzanp 2: De ang enskri ∠APB ak ∠AQB ouvè sou menm ark AB. Si ∠APB = 30°, konbyen ∠AQB? (Also 30°, since they intercept arc AB.)
Egzanp 3: Diamèt PR nan yon sèk bay ∠PQR kòm yon ang enskri. Si P, Q, R sou sèk la ak PR se yon dyamèt, ki mezi ∠PQR? (90°, Thales’ theorem: angle in a semicircle is right.)
Egzanp 4: Yon katilater (quadrilatère) ABCD enskri nan yon sèk. Si ∠A = 70° ak ∠C = 110°, verifye pwopriyete oposé yo. (70° + 110° = 180°, consistent with the theorem that ∠A + ∠C = 180° in a cyclic quadrilateral.) Find ∠B + ∠D as well (should also sum 180°, presumably 180°).
Egzanp 5: Nan yon sèk, ∠ABC = 35° ak AC se yon dyamèt. Jwenn ∠ADC si D se yon lòt pwen sou sèk la nan lòt bò arc AC a. (Arc AC is 180° since AC is diameter. ∠ADC intercepts arc ABC? Actually, D on circle on the side of AC forms inscribed angle ∠ADC intercepting arc AC. Because AC is diameter, ∠ADC = 90° by Thales. Alternatively, if D is chosen such that lines: Actually scenario might be unclear - if AC is diameter, any inscribed angle on arc AC is 90° regardless of B. Possibly they meant B somewhere else. Maybe skip or reframe: if AC diameter, pick B somewhere, ∠ABC is inscribed intercepting arc ADC? Unclear, skip for clarity.)
Egzanp 5 (revised): Sèk X: AB se yon dyamèt. Pwen C sou sèk la. Si ∠CAB = 28°, kalkile ∠CDB pou nenpòt lòt pwen D sou sèk la menm kote ak C (so that arcs match). (Trick: ∠CAB subtends arc CB. If D also on arc CB, then ∠CDB = ∠CAB = 28° as they see same arc. Alternatively, if D on arc AB the other side, then context changes. Possibly too complex as example, skip if confusing.)
Egzanp 6: Regular polygon angle: Yon sisdyagonal regilye (hexagon) enskri nan yon sèk. Konbyen degre yon ang an sant? (360/6 = 60°) Konbyen degre chak ang anndan sisdyagonal la? (Interior of regular hexagon is 120°; or via inscribed angle logic, arc for side = 60°, inscribed angle at center of polygon (vertex) intercepts arc of two adjacent arcs (120° arc?), might skip this formal in minimal context.)
Practice suggestions: Draw a circle with a central angle and an inscribed angle on the same arc; have students compute measures for several given values (like a quick table: central=80°, inscribed=? etc.). Provide diagrams of circles with multiple points and angles marked (some given numeric values, others algebraic expressions) for students to solve via inscribed angle relationships. For example, mark ∠ABC = 40°, ask for ∠ADC intercepting same arc, or vice versa. Practice identifying right angles: draw a circle, mark a diameter and a point to form a triangle, students must conclude that triangle is right-angled. Possibly use physical manipulatives: a circle drawn on paper, students use protractors to measure an inscribed and central angle for hands-on verification of the theorem (if in a classroom setting; here just describing how one might verify it).
Mini-Quiz/Review Ideas:
Flash Questions: “An inscribed angle subtends a 150° arc. What’s its measure?” (75°). “A central angle is twice an inscribed angle that sees the same arc: Vrai ou Faux?” (Vrai). Quick concept check items.
Diagram Mark-up: Give a blank circle diagram with points labeled and description like “O is center, ABCD are points on circle.” Ask a series: mark an inscribed angle equal to X, mark the corresponding central angle, etc., or fill in the blank angles. Possibly provide a partially completed diagram with some angle measures and ask to fill missing ones.
True/False reasoning: e.g. “Tout ang enskri ki subtandi menm ark egal.” (Vre) ; “Si yon ang an sant mezire 100°, nenpòt ang enskri ki subtandi menm ark la ap mezire 100° tou.” (Fò – it would be 50°). Have students correct false statements.
Cyclic Quadrilateral: Provide one with 3 angles given, ask to find the fourth and justify. This quickly tests if they grasp the inscribed angle relationships (opposite angles).
Connection question: “Why is an angle in a semicircle always 90°?” Have students explain briefly in their own words (in Creole) referencing the theorem (because the arc is 180°, central angle 180°, half is 90°). This tests deeper understanding beyond mechanical calculation.

Understand and state the definitions of sinus, kosinus, tengant for an acute angle in a right triangle: $\sin \theta = \frac{\text{opoze}}{\text{ipoteniz}}$, $\cos \theta = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{ipoteniz}}$, $\tan \theta = \frac{\text{opoze}}{\text{adjacent}}$ (using Creole/French terms: kote opoze, kote adjacent, ipotenuz).
Be able to label the sides of a right triangle relative to a chosen acute angle (opposite vs adjacent) and correctly apply the trig ratios to find missing side lengths . For example, if angle and hypotenuse are known, find opposite side: opposite = hyp * sin(angle).
Use a scientific calculator or trig tables to find sine, cosine, tangent values for given angles and to find angles from given ratios (inverse functions), rounding answers appropriately .
Solve practical problems using right-triangle trig: e.g. find the height of a tree given distance and angle of elevation, find the angle of a ramp given rise and run, etc. .
Memorize or derive values of sin, cos, tan for commonly used angles (30°, 45°, 60°)  and reinforce the fundamental identity $\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$ for any angle θ  (and note sin, cos of complementary angles relationship, since those appear in a right triangle scenario).
Key Concepts and Techniques:
Introducing sin, cos, tan: Use a right triangle with angle α. Opposite side (kòt opoze), adjacent side (kòt adjacent), hypotenuse (ipotenuz). Define $\sin \alpha = \frac{\text{opp}}{\text{hyp}}$, $\cos \alpha = \frac{\text{adj}}{\text{hyp}}$, $\tan \alpha = \frac{\text{opp}}{\text{adj}}$ . Use a mnemonic (if applicable in Creole) or logic: e.g. “SOH-CAH-TOA” (maybe introduced, but likely English mnemonic – could translate conceptually: Sin = Opp/Hyp…). Provide a concrete example: In a triangle with angle 30°, opposite = 5, hyp=10, so sin 30°=0.5.
Using the Ratios: Show how to solve for a side: e.g. if known angle and one side, pick the appropriate ratio. Example: Given a right triangle with ∠A = 40°, hypotenuse = 10 cm, find opposite side a = hyp * sin40°. Adjacent side b = hyp * cos40°. If instead adjacent side was given, and need hyp, use cos. Always set up $\sin$, $\cos$, or $\tan$ equation and solve for unknown, using reciprocal or direct multiplication. Emphasize calculator use in degree mode or table lookup for sine/cosine .
Finding an Angle: If sides are known (e.g. opposite=4, adjacent=5), compute ratio 4/5 = 0.8, then find angle = arctan(0.8). Explain how to use trig tables (or mention a table of e.g. sin 53° ≈0.8 to find angle ≈ 38° if not allowed calculators historically) . Reinforce that $\sin^{-1}, \cos^{-1}, \tan^{-1}$ (arcsin etc.) give angle from ratio. Possibly reference French terms: “arcsinus” but likely not needed beyond concept.
Angles of Elevation/Depression and Other Applications: Interpret problem language: angle of elevation (from horizontal up), angle of depression (downwards, which is congruent to elevation from ground by alternate interior angles). Solve at least one example thoroughly: e.g. “Yon moun kanpe 20m lwen yon batiman; ang elevasyon tèt bilding lan soti kote l kanpe se 30°. Konbyen apwoksimatif wotè bilding lan?” (Use tan30° = height/20, height = 20 * tan30° ≈ 11.55m). Also internal right-triangle contexts: ladder against wall (with frictionless assumption), finding distances. Include at least one using sine or cosine if horizontal distance known and hyp needed, etc.
Special Angles (30°, 45°, 60°): Use an equilateral triangle of side 2 to show 30°-60°-90° right triangle half of it: sides 1, √3, 2 (so sin30=0.5, cos30≈0.866, sin60≈0.866, cos60=0.5, tan30=1/√3, tan60=√3). Use an isosceles right triangle (45°-45°-90°) with legs 1,1, hyp √2: sin45 = cos45 ≈0.707, tan45=1 . Encourage memorizing these or deriving quickly. Also mention these appear in trig tables as common values.
Trig Identities: Mention in passing or show: cos is just sin of complement (since in right triangle, if one acute angle is θ, other is 90-θ, so cosθ = sin(90-θ) etc.), also $\sin^2 θ + \cos^2 θ = 1$ which comes from dividing all sides by hypotenuse and seeing a unit circle idea or just from Pythagoras (opp^2 + adj^2 = hyp^2, divide by hyp^2, get (opp/hyp)^2 + (adj/hyp)^2 = 1, i.e. sin²θ + cos²θ =1) . This could be a quick check for computations. Possibly mention $\tan θ = \sin θ / \cos θ$ relationship as well. Keep these to fundamental level.
Example Problems & Practice:
Egzanp 1: Nan △ABC ki rektang nan B, ∠A = 30°. Si AC (ipotenuz) = 10 cm, kalkile AB ak BC. (Here, AB opposite ∠C or adjacent? Actually, need clarity: If right at B, presumably ∠A=30 is one acute. AC hyp=10. Opposite ∠A (30°) is side BC, adjacent is AB. So BC = 10 * sin30 = 5 cm; AB = 10 * cos30 ≈ 8.66 cm.)
Egzanp 2: Yon ranp gen yon ang elevasyon 15° ak tè a. Si ranp la longè li (ipotenuz) se 5 m, ki wotè li monte? (height = 5 * sin15° ≈ 5 * 0.259 = 1.295 m.) Ki longè planche li kouvri sou tè a? (horizontal = 5 * cos15° ≈ 4.83 m.)
Egzanp 3: Rezoud triyang rektang: ∠C = 90°, ∠A = 55°, side a (BC) = 7 cm (side a opposite ∠A). Trouve: ∠B, side b (AC), side c (AB). (∠B = 35° since angles sum 180. side a=7 given = opp of 55°, side c = hyp: c = a/sin55 ≈ 7/0.819 = 8.55 cm. side b = adjacent to 55: b = c * cos55 ≈ 8.55 * 0.574 = 4.91 cm. Or b = a * cot55 etc. Provide results: ∠B=35°, AC≈4.91, AB≈8.55.)
Egzanp 4: Yon moun wè yon avyon nan syèl la ak yon ang depresyon 20° soti nan orizon li. Avyon an egzakteman anlè yon pwen ki 2 km lwen moun nan sou tè a. Approxime altitid avyon an. (tan(20°) = height/2 → height = 2 * tan20° ≈ 2 * 0.364 = 0.728 km, i.e. ~728 m.)
Egzanp 5: Ang envès: Yon pant monte 1 mèt vètikal pou chak 2 mèt orizontal. Ki ang pant sa a fè ak orizontal la? (tan θ = 1/2 = 0.5, θ = arctan(0.5). Using known value, arctan0.5 ≈ 26.565°, around 26.6°.)
Egzanp 6: Ang espesyal: Verifye kalkil: $\sin 30° = 0.5$, $\cos 60° = 0.5$, $\tan 45° = 1$, $\sin^2 30° + \cos^2 30° = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1$ (verify identity). Konplete tablo: (students fill maybe sin, cos for 0°,30°,45°,60°,90°).
Practice suggestions: After instruction, have students solve a set of mini-triangles: given one angle (other than 90) and one side, find the rest. Encourage diagram drawing for each. Include variety: sometimes given leg, sometimes hypotenuse. Practice also turning word descriptions into trig problems: e.g. “a kite string makes 40° with ground, 100m of string out, how high is kite?” (use sin). “A road has 8% grade (meaning 8m rise per 100m horizontal), what angle is that roughly?” (tanθ=0.08). For inverse practice, give some ratio and ask angle (like sinθ=0.707 -> θ~45°, tanθ=√3 -> θ=60° etc.). Also incorporate Pythagorean theorem use for checking or if two sides known find third then find angles by trig or by inverse trig. Possibly group work: one group derive sin, cos of 30°, another 45°, share results.
Mini-Quiz/Review Ideas:
Identify Ratios: A quick matching: match each ratio to sin, cos, or tan of angle given a triangle diagram. For example, show triangle with sides labeled relative to angle A, list ratios like 5/13, 12/13, 5/12 and have them identify which is sinA (5/13), cosA (12/13), tanA (5/12) given that context."

Math,NSI,Unit 4: Statistics and Data (Estatistik ak Done),"Analiz ak entèpretasyon – Interpreting real statistics examples: draw conclusions from a given data set or chart (e.g. finding which category is most frequent, comparing distributions) .","Learning Objectives:
Understand basic terminology: popilasyon, echantilon (echantiyon), varyab (statistical variable), and types of variables: qualitative (katégorik) vs quantitative (nimerik) discrete or continuous.
Be able to organize raw data into a frequency table, listing each distinct value or category and its frequency (efektif). Compute relative frequency (pousantaj) as needed. Also know “cumulative frequency” (frekans sume for data ≤ a certain value) .
Calculate measures of central tendency: mwayèn (mean) as sum of values / count; medyàn as middle value (or average of two middle if even count) when data sorted; mod as the most frequent value . Understand what each measure indicates and scenarios where one is more representative (e.g. mean sensitive to outliers, median more robust, mode useful for nominal data).
Determine range (etandu) = max - min, as a simple measure of spread. Possibly mention other dispersion measure like if introduced, but likely not beyond range for minimal.
Construct and interpret graphs:
Bar chart (diagram baton) for categorical or discrete data: bars separated, heights show frequency or percent.
Pie chart (diagram sikilè): how to compute angle for each category = percentage * 360°.
Histogram (istogram) for grouped continuous data: adjacent bars. Understand difference between bar chart and histogram (bars touch in histogram if continuous). Possibly mention line graphs for trends over time.
Line plot or dot plot (maybe not in official, but any similar simple display).
Read a given chart to answer questions: which group is largest, what is total count, etc.
Interpret statistical findings in context: e.g. given mean or median, say what it implies about typical value. Recognize that statistics summarize data and must be reported with context (units, etc.).
Appreciate practical usage: e.g. finding class average, understanding distribution of exam scores, analyzing a simple survey of preferences in class.
Key Concepts and Techniques:
Data Collection: Mention surveys, recordings, etc. If possible, use an example data set: e.g. ages of students in class, or number of siblings each student has, or favorite color poll. Distinguish variable type: siblings (quantitative discrete), favorite color (qualitative nominal), height (quantitative continuous typically).
Frequency Table: Show raw list -> table. For a small example: data: 2,5,2,3,5,5. Frequency: 2 appears 2 times, 3 once, 5 three times. Add columns for relative freq (2/6 etc.) if needed. Show cumulative: e.g. ≤2:2, ≤3:3, ≤5:6 (which is total).
Mean/Median/Mode calculation: Do small example with odd count (e.g. 5 numbers) to find median easily. Then an even count case. Emphasize sorting data for median. For mode, mention can be more than one mode (bimodal) or none (if all equal freq). Possibly note mean vs median differences if outlier present: e.g. incomes example or test scores.
Charts: Possibly use same dataset to draw a bar chart (if categorical or for distinct small number of values). Show labeling axes, uniform bar widths, etc. For pie, perhaps simpler to use a categorical example (like favorite fruits percentages) and computing degrees (like if 50% like mango, then 180° slice). If tools or by eyeballing approximate, but mention formula. Histograms if grouping needed: maybe show how to group continuous or many distinct values into classes (0-9, 10-19 etc.), then frequencies for those. Histograms are often taught but might be advanced if grouping concept not deeply done. But as doc mentions histograms , so likely required to mention. Could show small example: heights of students binned by interval.
Interpretation: Pose questions like: which category has highest frequency, what is mean telling us vs median, etc. Use example: if mean score is 70, median 80, maybe implies distribution skewed lower by some very low scores. If mode = 85, many got 85. Show caution: one measure doesn’t tell all. Possibly mention outlier concept (though not explicitly required, but could mention in context of mean).
Contextual understanding: Connect to everyday: media might talk about average income or median income differences; mode in fashion (most common size sold, etc.). Simpler: teacher computing class average and median to gauge performance.
Example Problems & Practice:
Egzanp 1: Men done pou kantite liv 10 elèv li pandan yon mwa: 2, 5, 0, 3, 2, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3. (a) Konstwi yon tablo frekans. (Value 0:1, 1:1, 2:3, 3:2, 4:1, 5:2) (b) Ki mod la? (2 is mode (freq3). If mention “bimodal if tie”, but here one mode.) (c) Kalkile mwayèn kantite liv yo. (Sum=27, mean=27/10=2.7 books.) (d) Jwenn medyàn. (Sort data:0,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,5,5 -> median = average of 5th and 6th = (2+3)/2 = 2.5.)
Egzanp 2: Nan yon sondaj, koulè preferer 30 elèv: Wouj(10 elèv), Vèt(5), Ble(9), Jòn(6). Fè yon diagram baton pou done sa yo. (Bar chart with four bars labeled colors, heights accordingly.) Fè yon diagram sikilè tou. (Total=30, so red 10 -> 10/30=33.3% ~120°, etc: green 60°, blue ~108°, yellow ~72°.) Ki koulè ki plis popilè? (Rouj) Apeprè ki pousantaj elèv ki prefere jòn? (6/30=20%).
Egzanp 3: Wotè (an cm) 5 plant tomat: 40, 55, 50, 45, 110. Kalkile mwayèn ak medyàn wotè. (Mean = (40+55+50+45+110)/5 = 300/5=60 cm; median sorted (40,45,50,55,110) median=50 cm.) Ki mezi sant ki pi bon pou dekri gwosè tipik plant yo? Poukisa? (Median=50 might be better as typical because mean was pulled up by one very tall 110 outlier. Good to see if they understand outlier effect.)
Egzanp 4: Bati yon istogram pou done sa yo sou nòt elèv (sou 100): 0-49: 4 elèv, 50-59: 6 elèv, 60-69: 10 elèv, 70-79: 8 elèv, 80-89: 5 elèv, 90-100: 2 elèv. (Draw contiguous bars spanning those intervals on x-axis, height equal to frequency given.) Konbyen elèv total? (4+6+10+8+5+2 = 35) Ki klas nòt ki gen pi gwo frekans? (60-69 has 10) Konbyen elèv pase egzamen an si pasmak se 60? (All with ≥60, so those in 60-69,70-79,…90-100: 10+8+5+2=25 passed.) Ki pousantaj sa reprezante? (25/35 ≈ 71.4%).
Egzanp 5: (Interpretation): Tablo ki anba bay kantite timoun nan 7 fanmi: Valeur:0,1,2,3,4,5,6; Frekans:1, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 0. (a) Konbyen fanmi ki genyen plis pase 3 timoun? (Those with 4,5,6 kids: freq 1+1+0=2 families) (b) Konbyen timoun total sa fè? (Total children = Σ(valuefreq) =01+10+23+31+41+51+60 = 0+0+6+3+4+5+0 =18) (c) Ki mwayèn timoun pa fanmi? (18 kids/7 families ≈2.57) (d) Mode? (2 kids, freq3) (e) Median? (List out counts by families: 0,2,2,2,3,4,5 (since one of each those except 1 and 6 which are 0 freq), median = 3rd value if sorted [0,2,2,2,3,4,5] = 2).
Practice suggestions: Have students gather some small data themselves (like how many siblings each student has, or how many hours they study, etc.), then make a frequency table from class, compute measures, discuss what is typical. Provide raw unsorted data for them to practice making a table and calculating mean/median. Use real context: e.g. rainfall in last 5 days, find average rainfall. Or sports: points scored by team each game, find average points, which game was median performance, etc. Provide an already made graph (like from textbook or newspaper chart) and ask interpretive questions. Perhaps simulate drawing random data from hat and then summarizing.
Mini-Quiz/Review Ideas:
Terminology: Ask definitions: “What is the median?” or “What does ‘population’ mean vs ‘sample’?” short answer. Or match term to definition (mean, mode, median). Possibly “Which measure is middle value when sorted?” etc.
Calculation Check: small set e.g. [5,7,3,5,10] find mode (5), mean (30/5=6), median (5 sorted [3,5,5,7,10] median =5). Quick mental if manageable. Or a quick frequency table question: “If 10 numbers average to 8, what is their total?” (80).
Graph reading: Show a bar graph with categories and ask “which category is highest? how many in category X?” etc. Or a tiny histogram and ask “how many observations are between this and that?”
Which measure to use: Give scenario: “Incomes in a village where one person is extremely rich, others modest; which is better summary, mean or median?” expecting “median.” Or “If survey asks most liked flavor, which measure of central tendency (mean/median/mode) makes sense?” (Mode, since nominal data).
True/False: “If data are {2,4,6,8}, mean = median.” (True, both 5). “Adding a constant to all data increases mean by that constant.” (True). “If a data set has two modes, it means two values tie for highest frequency.” (True). “A histogram is used for categorical data.” (False, bar chart for categorical, histogram continuous). “The sum of frequencies in a table equals sample size.” (True).

Master systematic listing: be able to enumerate all possible outcomes in small sample spaces using organized methods (trees, grids) . For example, list outcomes of two coin tosses, or all outfits from 3 shirts and 2 pants, etc.
Understand the multiplication principle (multiplicative rule of counting) for independent choices: if there are p options for one choice and q for another, total outcomes = p×q. Extend to more factors (e.g. how many 3-letter words from 26 letters: 26×26×26 assuming repetition allowed).
Use counting techniques in classic scenarios:
With dice: number of ways to roll a sum, or outcomes of multiple dice .
With playing cards: count number of ways to draw certain cards (though combinations formula might be beyond, can do small counts).
With digits: forming numbers under certain conditions (like how many 2-digit numbers can be formed from set {1,2,3} without repetition, etc.).
Recognize when to add instead of multiply (addition principle for mutually exclusive cases) e.g. count outcomes satisfying one condition or another by summing counts from separate cases.
(If introduced) Relate counting to basic probability: if each outcome equally likely, probability = count of favorable / count of total. Solve simple probability problems using counting (like chance of drawing a red card from deck etc.)
Develop problem-solving skills by applying counting to new situations, and check results by simpler reasoning if possible (e.g. verifying small cases by listing).
Key Concepts and Techniques:
Tree Diagrams: Draw branching diagrams for sequential events. E.g. toss coin then roll die – first branch coin (H,T), each branch splits into 6 die faces, total 2×6=12 outcomes. Illustrate how tree organizes them (e.g. H1,H2…H6, T1…T6). Emphasize each path = one outcome. Useful for breaking down multi-stage problems where manual list is feasible.
Tables/Grids: For two-step processes, a matrix can list outcomes (like a 2D table of shirts vs pants combos).
Multiplicative Principle: State: if events/choices are independent (i.e., any combination can occur), multiply the number of options for each stage. Provide simple proofs or intuitive reasoning (each option of first can pair with all options of second, etc.). Use small numbers to illustrate then bigger.
Additive Principle: If a scenario splits into distinct cases that don’t overlap, count each case then sum. For example, count 2-digit even numbers from digits etc: treat cases where last digit is 0 or 2, etc.
Examples: Counting permutations vs combinations might be beyond minimal competences, but maybe small such tasks: e.g. how many ways to arrange 3 people in a line (3! =6). If combination concept needed, keep to simple e.g. how many ways to choose 2 out of 4 things (6), possibly just use logic.
Games and Real Items: Use contexts: e.g. if license plates format XY123 (2 letters + 3 digits), how many possible? If no repetition in letters, how many? etc. Connect to everyday where counting needed (like how many phone numbers possible with 7 digits, to see scale).
Hands-on or Simulations: The document suggests using cards, dice, numbers . E.g. show how to count outcomes by actual experiments (list possible outcomes of drawing two cards from a small deck etc.). Encourage verifying with actual small experiments.
Counting -> Probability: If comfortable, tie in: e.g. Probability of rolling sum 7 on two dice = (count outcomes summing to 7)/(total 36) = 6/36 = 1/6. This is a nice culminating view but could be left to a mention.

Egzanp 2: Si woul yon kib (zo) ak lanse yon pyès, montre tout rezilta posib yo ak yon dyagram pyebwa. (Coin: H,T; each leads to Die:1-6. List combos e.g. H1,…,H6, T1,…,T6. Total 12 outcomes.)
Egzanp 3: Konbyen nimewo 2-chif diferan ou ka fòme ak chif 1, 3, 5, 7 san repete menm chif? (For tens and ones, 4 choices for tens (since cannot be 0 here, only given digits), then 3 for ones. 4×3 = 12 numbers.) Ki nimewo sa yo? (List them like 13,15,17, 31,35,37,… etc to double-check count.)
Egzanp 4: Gen 10 elèv nan yon konkou. Konbyen fason pri premye, dezyèm ak twazyèm plas ka at tribiye? (That’s permutations of 10 taken 3: 10×9×8 = 720 ways.)
Egzanp 5: (Kesyon ak ka): Yon klas gen 5 gason ak 4 fi. Prof bay yon rekonpans swa a yon gason swa a yon fi. Konbyen fason pou chwazi: (a) yon gason oswa yon fi? (Case 1: choose 1 boy out of 5 or 1 girl out of 4 → 5+4=9 ways.) (b) yon gason epi yon fi? (Now one boy AND one girl: that’s independent choice, 5×4 =20 ways.)
Egzanp 6: Kat: Nan yon pil 52 kat, konbyen posib ou ka tire yon wa? (4 ways favorable) Konbyen posib ou ka tire nenpòt kat? (52 total) Probabilité (if introduced) =4/52=1/13. (Even if probability not focus, can still count 4 kings, etc.)
Egzanp 7: Bon: Yon kòd PIN gen 4 chif (0-9 chak). Konbyen PIN diferan egziste? (10^4 = 10,000.) E si pa gen chif ki repete? (10987 = 5040.)*
Egzanp 8: Dés: Konbyen fason ou ka jete de zo kote sòm pwen yo egal 7? (Outcomes summing to7: (1,6),(2,5),(3,4),(4,3),(5,2),(6,1) =6 ways.) Ki posiblite total lè ou jete 2 zo? (36). Si chak posiblite egal chans, ki pwobabilite pou fè 7? (6/36=1/6)
Practice suggestions: Use real or imagined scenarios to exercise counting: e.g. different outfits, routes on a grid (maybe small grid with steps down and right, though that requires combinations formula, but maybe just small case enumeration). Have students create tree diagrams for coin flips, or picking marbles from a bag sequentially (with or without replacement, to highlight differences). Play small lottery or permutation games: e.g. how many 3-digit codes can you guess, etc. For addition vs multiplication, pose combined tasks: “if either A or B happens, count total” to ensure they don’t multiply when should add. Possibly quick combinatorial reasoning puzzle (like handshake problem: 5 people shake hands once with each other, how many handshakes? = C(5,2)=10, which can be reasoned by sum or formula). Keep it fun to show counting is useful.
Mini-Quiz/Review Ideas:
Simple multiply: “With 4 cookie flavors and 3 ice cream flavors, how many cookie sandwiches (two cookies+ice cream) possible?” (434? If two cookies possibly same or not; could trick: if they allow two same or treat as order matters if different? might be too complex, better straightforward: if one cookie flavor and one scoop, 4*3=12 combos if cookie flavor repeated fine). So simpler: “1 cookie + 1 ice cream combos? 12.”
Brain Teaser counting: “A password has 2 letters (A-Z) followed by 1 digit (0-9). How many passwords?” (262610=6760). “If repetition not allowed in letters?” (262510).
List small outcomes: “List all outcomes of flipping 2 coins and count them.” (HH, HT, TH, TT =4). “If one coin and one 6-sided die, how many outcomes? Without listing, try use multiplication =2*6=12.”
True/False: “6 boys and 6 girls can sit on a bench in 12! ways.” (True if order matters and all distinct; enormous number though). “Number of 5-digit numbers is 10^5.” (False, that includes leading 0 case which wouldn’t be 5-digit; correct is 90000 if first digit 1-9). “Tossing 3 fair coins has 6 possible outcomes.” (False, it’s 8). “Drawing 2 cards from 52 one after another yields 52*51 outcomes if order matters.” (True). Possibly skip tricky ones unless taught thoroughly.
Permutation example: “In how many ways can gold, silver, bronze medals be awarded to 7 contestants?” give multiple choice (like 210, 35, 343, 7P3=210? Actually 765=210, yes). Or simpler: “3 people in a line have 3!=6 orders. If 4 people, how many orders? (24)”.
Little probabilities if allowed: “Probability of a 2-digit number chosen at random being even?” (Half of them are even likely, if uniform, illustrate count even vs total; e.g. 45 evens out of 90 two-digit numbers =1/2). Or “Roll 2 dice, chance to get double (both same)? (6/36=1/6).” This checks linking counting to probability conceptually.

Learn a structured approach to problem solving (George Pólya’s four steps): 1) Understand the problem, 2) Devise a plan, 3) Carry out the plan, 4) Look back and verify  .
Practice step 1 by carefully reading problems, identifying known vs unknown, and drawing diagrams or restating the problem in simpler terms. Highlight importance of units and context (e.g. is answer in meters? gourdes?).
Familiarize with various heuristic strategies for step 2: e.g. résoud pa etap (solve a simpler sub-problem first), fè yon lis (list out possibilities), desine yon foto (draw a picture or diagram), devine ak tcheke (guess and check), chwèche modèl (look for a pattern), fòme yon ekwasyon (set up an equation) . Know that multiple strategies might apply and choosing one comes with practice .
Emphasize step 3: implementing solution carefully, showing work, being patient if initial approach doesn’t immediately yield result (persist or try alternate plan). Understand that making mistakes is part of solving and one should learn from them.
Emphasize step 4: check if the answer makes sense (no unit mistakes, no unrealistic values). If possible, verify by plugging result back into original conditions. Reflect on whether there was an easier method or what was learned, reinforcing future problem solving ability .
Build confidence by solving a variety of problems (word problems from earlier units: arithmetic applications, geometry scenarios, algebra puzzles) using these strategies. Develop the habit of not giving up and approaching problems systematically.
Key Concepts and Techniques:
Understanding the Problem: Teach students to ask themselves: “Ki enfòmasyon yo ban mwen? Kisa yo mande mwen jwenn? Eske gen pawòl kle?” . For example, a distance problem might have “total distance” and “average speed” – ensure they know what those mean. Encourage summarizing: “An rezime, pwoblèm nan di…”.
Devise Plan: Introduce a “toolbox” of strategies . Perhaps list common ones: guess & check, draw diagram, make an equation, break into smaller parts, use symmetry, consider special cases . Use a specific example to illustrate each: e.g. guess & check in a number riddle, drawing a geometric figure for a perimeter problem, etc. Emphasize there is no one right way, creativity and experience help.
Carry Out Plan: Encourage neat work, stepwise solving. If it’s long, maybe break it and check intermediate results. If a plan fails, reflect why and try another approach (don’t see it as failure, but information gained).
Look Back: Always verify units (like if you got 13.5 students as answer, something’s off since can’t have half student). Check calculation (maybe recompute quickly or approximate to see if reasonable). If possible, solve the problem by another method as confirmation . Or plug answer into original to see if conditions met. Reflection also includes generalizing: “Could this method solve other problems? What if some data changed?” to deepen understanding.
Worked Example: Possibly walk through a classic problem applying each step explicitly. For instance, a well-known puzzle: “An old man dies leaving 17 cows to his three sons with certain fraction rules… how to divide?” or a simpler one: “Find two numbers given their sum and product.” Show reading, planning (maybe set equations), executing (solve equations), checking (do found numbers satisfy both?). Or an everyday: “If one travels part distance at one speed and rest at another, find total time.” The point is to illustrate the process in action.
Encourage Polya’s principles: If stuck, try something, even if not sure it will lead to answer (trial helps understand problem better) . Also “look back” fosters learning for future so emphasize it’s not over when answer found.
Example Problems & Practice:
Egzanp 1: Pwoblèm: “Yon rechany chache kalkile laj li ak laj pitit li yo. Li di: ‘Soma laj mwen ak lajo pitit fi mwen an se 50 an, e li gen 30 an mwens pase mwen. Ki laj chak?’” Solisyon gid: (Step 1) Konprann: Sipoze manman = M, pitit fi = F. Nou konnen M + F = 50, epi F = M - 30. (Step 2) Plan: Nou ka itilize metòd algèbik: de ekwasyon lineyè . (Step 3) Egzekite: Soti F = M - 30, ranplase nan M + F = 50 → M + (M-30) = 50 → 2M - 30 = 50 → 2M = 80 → M = 40, konsa F = 10. (Step 4) Verifye: 40 + 10 = 50, diferans laj = 30, sa mache. Repons: Manman an gen 40 an, pitit fi a 10 an.
Egzanp 2: Pwoblèm jeometri: “Nan yon jaden rektangilè ki mezire 20 m pa 10 m, nou vle mete yon kòn beton (walkway) egalman lwen de tout kote yo. Ki dyamèt maksimòm kòn nan ka genyen?” Diskite plan: Desine rektang, imajine sik anndan. Mwaye sik la dwe nan sant rektang la pou l egal distans de bor yo. Dyamèt max = ti dimansyon rektang lan (10 m). (Truly: radius = 5 m to just touch shorter side). Solisyon: 10 m. (Went through draw and logic).
Egzanp 3: Pwoblèm lous (multi-step): “Yon lous tonbe nan yon gwo twou 50 m pwofondè. Chak jou li monte 5 m nan maten, men glise desann 3 m chak swa. Konbyen jou sa ap pran pou l sòti twou a?” Rezoud: (Step 1) Konprann: effectively +2 m net per day except maybe last. (Step 2) Plan: simulate jou pa jou or find formula. (Step 3) Egzekite: Apre 1 jou (apremidi) li nan 2 m, 2 jou: 4 m, … n jou: 2n m avan monte nan n-th maten. We want find smallest n such that at maten li soti. Actually realize on last morning climb he might exit without sliding. So set (n-1) days net + last climb ≥50. So 2*(n-1) + 5 ≥ 50 → 2n - 2 + 5 ≥ 50 → 2n ≥ 47 → n ≥ 23.5 → n =24 days. (Step 4) Check by sim: After 23 days, net=46 m, morning 24th goes to 51m out of hole. So 24 days.
Egzanp 4: Chèche modèl: “Jwenn dènye chif (unit digit) nimewo $7^{2025}$.” Reflect method: Recognize pattern in powers of 7: 7^1 ends 7, 7^2 ends 9, 7^3 ends 3, 7^4 ends 1, and 7^5 again 7, so cycle of 4. 2025 mod4 = 1 (since 2024 is multiple of4), so behaves like 7^1 → dènye chif = 7.
Egzanp 5: Rezoud ak tcheke: “Panse ak yon nimewo. Miltipliye li pa 6, ajoute 8, divize pa 2, epi soustrai 4, ou retounen jwenn nimewo a ou te panse a. Ki nimewo sa ye?” Plan: Defini x = nombre. Equation from steps: (((6x + 8)/2) - 4 = x). Solve: (6x+8)/2 -4 = x → 3x+4 -4 = x → 3x = x → 2x=0 → x=0. Verify: Try the operations on 0: 0*6=0, +8=8, /2=4, -4=0, yep.
Egzanp 6: Pwoblèm open-ended: “Chèche de nimewo ki miltiplikasyon yo egal 48 epi ki gen diferans ki pi piti posib.” Diskite posiblite: Faktè 48: (1,48), diff47; (2,24) diff22; (3,16) diff13; (4,12) diff8; (6,8) diff2. So 6 and 8 best.
Practice suggestions: Give students a complex word problem and have them work in groups to apply the four steps; for instance, a mixture problem or rate problem. They should articulate each step. Another idea: present a solved problem but with steps jumbled or a mistake, have them correct it. Puzzles or riddles (within their ability) can make it engaging. Possibly incorporate problems that require multi-topic knowledge, like geometry plus arithmetic (like the bear walking puzzle uses logic more, but simpler such as logic puzzle “two people age sum/difference”). Also encourage them to come up with their own problem and solve it using Polya steps to reinforce the method.
Mini-Quiz/Review Ideas:
Polya Steps Q: List the four problem-solving steps in order (they can answer in Creole descriptions). Or ask: “After solving a problem, what should you do?” (Expect “check your work/look back”).
Strategy identification: Describe a strategy: “I will try small cases to see a pattern” and ask which strategy that is (looking for “simplify the problem” or “look for pattern”). Or “I draw a picture of the situation” (strategy: draw diagram).
Correcting a plan: Provide a scenario: “A student sees ‘sum is 10, product is 21’ and says ‘the numbers are 7 and 3’ immediately by guess. What step did they skip?” (Understanding or verifying possibly). Or short answer: “Why is it important to check the answer?”
Simpler sub-problem: Present a tough problem and ask, “Name one thing you could do if you don’t see the solution right away.” (Expected: try simpler numbers, guess and check some values, etc.).
True/False or Vrai/Fò: “If at first you don’t succeed, give up.” (False! try a different approach). “Drawing a figure can help solve some word problems.” (True). “The solution of a problem should always be checked in the original statement.” (True).
Micro-problem: e.g. “Polya suggests first step ‘Understand’. If a problem asks for area of a circle with radius 5, what are key data and goal?” (Data: radius=5, goal: area formula πr²). Or a trivial puzzle for quick strategy application (like a lateral thinking: “What number is missing in sequence 2,4,__,8,…” etc., see if they identify pattern strategy).
Each lesson across all units integrates Haitian Creole language with French mathematical terms (in italics or parentheses) where needed, ensuring students become comfortable with terminology in both languages. By completing this curriculum, students will strengthen their mathematical skills and problem-solving abilities, preparing them for further studies in Math NS II and everyday quantitative reasoning.

Understand the concept of a vector as a quantity with magnitude (length) and direction. Represent a vector in diagrams as an arrow, and denote it using notation like →AB (from point A to B) or a single letter like u with an arrow.
Recognize when two vectors are equal (same length and direction, regardless of starting position)  and know basic vector terminology in Creole/French (e.g. vèktè, modil (magnitude), direksyon ak sans).
Perform vector addition geometrically (tip-to-tail or parallelogram method) and understand scalar multiplication (e.g. 2u is a vector in the same direction as u but twice as long; -1 * u is opposite direction) .
Calculate coordinates of a vector in the plane: given endpoints, find difference in x and y . Use coordinates to add vectors (add their components) and to multiply by scalars (multiply each component).
Compute the norm (length) of a vector given its components using $||\mathbf{v}|| = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}$; compute the distance between two points (as the norm of the difference vector)  . Compute the midpoint of segment AB as $(\frac{x_A+x_B}{2}, \frac{y_A+y_B}{2})$.
Determine conditions for parallel vectors: v and w are collinear if $\mathbf{v} = k\mathbf{w}$ for some scalar k  (their components are proportional). Determine orthogonal (perpendicular) vectors: their dot product is 0 (if covering dot product concept) or slope of one is negative reciprocal of the other if both non-vertical . Use vector methods to show three points are collinear (e.g. →AB and →AC are collinear) or two lines are parallel/perpendicular  .
Apply vectors to problem solving: e.g. find a point such that the vector from it has certain properties, use midpoints and parallel vectors to show a shape is a parallelogram, relate to Thales by seeing that co-linear midpoints or parallel lines produce proportional vectors  .
Key Concepts and Techniques:
Vector Basics: Illustrate vectors as arrows on graph paper: one from (0,0) to (3,2) and another from (1,1) to (4,3) – show they are equal because they have same “move” (right 3, up 2). Emphasize difference between a vector (movement) and a point (location). If using physical interpretation: displacement, forces, etc., but mainly geometric. Show notation: $\overrightarrow{AB}$ means vector from A to B. A vector can be “slid” parallel to itself without changing it .
Addition: Geometrically place tail of one at head of other; resultant from start of first to end of second. Parallelogram rule: draw both from same start point, complete parallelogram, diagonal is sum vector. Algebraically: $(v_x, v_y) + (w_x, w_y) = (v_x+w_x,; v_y+w_y)$. Show a numeric example. Ensure students see zero vector concept (vector of length 0, no direction).
Scalar Multiplication: e.g. 2*(3,2) = (6,4) – twice as long, same direction. Negative scalar flips direction: -1*(3,2) = (-3,-2). Connect with geometry: if u goes East, 2u goes twice as far East; -u goes same distance West.
Coordinates of a Point vs Vector: Clarify a point P(x,y) vs a vector (x,y) meaning x and y are components. If $A(x_A,y_A)$ and $B(x_B,y_B)$, then $\overrightarrow{AB} = (x_B-x_A,; y_B - y_A)$ . Check if students can derive that formula easily with an example.
Distance and Norm: The length of $\overrightarrow{AB}$ by distance formula: $|\overrightarrow{AB}| = \sqrt{(x_B-x_A)^2 + (y_B-y_A)^2}$. This is just the Pythagorean result. Midpoint: average coordinates. Show how midpoint formula comes from vector viewpoint: $\overrightarrow{AM} = \frac{1}{2}\overrightarrow{AB}$, thus M = A + 0.5*(AB vector). So coordinates are average of A and B coordinates .
Parallel/Collinear: If $\overrightarrow{u} = (a,b)$ and $\overrightarrow{v}=(c,d)$, they are parallel (colinear direction) if $(a,b) = k(c,d)$ i.e. $a = kc,; b = kd$. Equivalently $a d = b c$ (if not zero) to check proportionality (since $a/c = b/d = k$, cross-multiply yields $a d = b c$). Use an example: (2,4) and (1,2) -> 2,4 is 2*(1,2), so yes parallel. For collinearity of points A, B, C: check if $\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\overrightarrow{AC}$ are colinear, i.e. one is scalar multiple of the other .
Perpendicular: Dot product introduction if allowed: $\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = a c + b d$. If =0, then orthogonal. Or slope method: slope of u = b/a, slope of v = d/c, if one * other = -1, then perpendicular (assuming neither vertical/horizontal special case). Show example: (3,4) dot (4,-3) = 12 -12 =0, hence perpendicular.
Vectors for Equation of Lines: Possibly mention that a direction vector of a line can be used to write parametric equations: e.g. line through A with direction vector v: $A + t\mathbf{v}$ gives all points (this is advanced, maybe skip if minimal comp). But at least mention the concept: if $\overrightarrow{AB}$ gives direction of line, any multiple covers line AB .
Link to transformations: Indicate how a translation is basically adding a fixed vector to all points (so translation by vector (p,q) means every point (x,y) goes to (x+p, y+q)). Homothety (scaling) multiplies position vectors by a scalar relative to center (ties to scalar multiplication concept). But keep brief.
Applications: Use vector approach to prove midpoint theorem: In a triangle, midpoints of two sides connected, that segment is parallel to third side and half its length. Show if M, N are midpoints of AB and AC, then $\overrightarrow{MN} = \frac{1}{2}\overrightarrow{BC}$ (leading to parallel and half length). Mention how Thales can be seen as vector ratios as well. Solve a basic vector equation: e.g. Given points and a ratio, find a coordinate (like find point that divides AB in 2:3 ratio by vector interpolation – might be heavy, but mention if time).
Example Problems & Practice:
Egzanp 1: Si $\mathbf{u} = \overrightarrow{AB}$ ak $A(1,2)$, $B(4, 6)$, jwenn koordinat $\mathbf{u}$. (Compute: (4-1, 6-2) = (3,4).)  Ki longè $\mathbf{u}$? (Length = √(3²+4²) = 5.)
Egzanp 2: Done $\mathbf{v} = (−2, 5)$, kalkile: (a) $2\mathbf{v}$; (b) $-1/2 \mathbf{v}$. (a) (-4,10); (b) (1, -2.5).)
Egzanp 3: $M$ se mitan segment $[PQ]$ kote $P(2, -1)$ ak $Q(8, 5)$. Jwenn koordinat $M$. (Average: ((2+8)/2, (-1+5)/2) = (5,2).) Verifye ke $\overrightarrow{PM} = \frac{1}{2}\overrightarrow{PQ}$ (compute both: PQ=(6,6), PM=(3,3)).
Egzanp 4: Tcheke si vektè $\mathbf{a} = (6, 9)$ ak $\mathbf{b} = (–4, –6)$ paralèl. (See ratio 6:(-4) = -1.5, 9:(-6) = -1.5, same k = -1.5, yes parallel but opposite direction since k negative.) Are they perpendicular? (No, dot =6*(-4)+9*(-6) = -24 -54 = -78 ≠ 0.)
Egzanp 5: Koordinat pwen A, B, C: $A(0,0)$, $B(2,3)$, $C(4,6)$. Eske A, B, C kolinyè? (Compute AB=(2,3), AC=(4,6). AC = 2(2,3) = 2AB, so yes collinear. All three on a line.)
Egzanp 6: Paralelogram: $ABCD$ se yon paralelogram si $\overrightarrow{AB} = \overrightarrow{DC}$ ak $\overrightarrow{AD} = \overrightarrow{BC}$. Donn $A(1,1), B(4,3), D(2,5)$. Trouve $C$ such that ABCD is parallelogram. (We have AB=(3,2), AD=(1,4). For parallelogram, C = B + (AD) = (4+1, 3+4) = (5,7). Or using DC = AB: D to C vector should equal (3,2), so C = D+(3,2) = (5,7) same result.) Verify by vectors that AB || CD and AD || BC.
Egzanp 7: Thalès/Proportion: Si $\overrightarrow{AB} = (6,0)$ ak $\overrightarrow{AC} = (4, 6)$, verifye si $2\overrightarrow{AB} = 3\overrightarrow{AC}$? (2AB = (12,0), 3AC=(12,18), not equal, so not in that ratio; basically check if B is 2/3 fraction along AC etc. This might not directly show Thales, skip if confusing.)
Practice suggestions: Provide sets of points to find vectors and test parallel/perpendicular. Practice computing midpoints and distances between points using vector formulas. Use simple numeric component vectors for addition/subtraction drills. Possibly include an exercise of finding a unit vector in the direction of a given vector (divide vector by its norm) if appropriate. Ask students to draw a couple of vectors on graph paper and perform head-to-tail addition visually, then verify by coordinates. For conceptual understanding, present a small “proof” problem: if M and N are midpoints, show $\overrightarrow{MN} = \frac{1}{2}\overrightarrow{BC}$ as a demonstration of vector usefulness (with coordinates or general variables).
Mini-Quiz/Review Ideas:
Component Quickies: “If $\overrightarrow{XY} = (7,-2)$, what are the coordinates of Y if X = (1,4)?” (Answer: (8,2) by adding vector to X). “What vector when added to (3,1) gives (0,0)?” (Answer: (-3,-1)). Quick mental or one-step items.
True/False: “Deux vecteurs égaux ont même direction et même longueur” (True); “(2,5) and (–4, –10) are parallel” (True, since second is -2 times first); “If $\overrightarrow{u} \parallel \overrightarrow{v}$ and $\overrightarrow{v} \parallel \overrightarrow{w}$, then $\overrightarrow{u} \parallel \overrightarrow{w}$” (True, parallelism transitive). “If $\overrightarrow{OA} = (a,b)$ and $\overrightarrow{OB}=(c,d)$, then $\overrightarrow{AB}=(a-c,; b-d)$” (False, correct formula is opposite sign).
Coordinate Geometry check: Provide two endpoints of a segment, ask for midpoint or length as a quick question. Or give three points and ask if one is midpoint of the segment formed by other two (check by averaging coordinates).
Collinearity test: Give coordinates of three points, students quickly compute two vectors and check proportionality. E.g. A(1,2), B(3,6), C(5,10) – likely collinear (differences: AB(2,4), BC(2,4) yes equal; or AB and AC check).
Dot product (if taught) challenge: Provide two pairs of vectors and ask which pair is perpendicular. Eg: u=(2,5), v=(5,-2) dot = 0? (Yes, 10-10=0) or test others. If dot not taught, just conceptual: “Vector (3,4) perpendicular to which: (4,-3) or (-4,-3)?” (the first, since 34+4(-3)=0).
Translation application: Describe a translation by vector, e.g. (x,y) -> (x+3, y-2) and ask where a given point moves (like (1,1) -> (4,-1)). This connects vector to geometry transformation.

State Thales’ Theorem in own words (Creole): “Si yon liy paralèl ak yon kote yon triyang koupe de lòt kote yo, li separe yo an pati pwopòsyonèl.” i.e. if DE ∥ AB in triangle ABC, then CD/CA = CE/CB . Also understand the converse: if segments are proportional, lines are parallel .
Use Thales’ theorem to set up proportions and solve for unknown lengths in figures with parallel lines. For example, if a small triangle is inside a larger one sharing angle at vertex, form proportion of sides to find missing side .
Identify similar triangles in diagrams (often from parallel lines creating equal angles). Understand similarity criteria (angle-angle-angle suffices, etc.). Once triangles are similar, set up ratios of corresponding sides to find missing measures .
Apply similarity to practical contexts: measure widths or heights indirectly (e.g. using shadows or mirrors), use scale drawings or maps (knowing scale factor to get actual distances). Recognize similarity in shapes: e.g. all circles are similar (maybe not covered in detail), or rectangular figures.
Perform construction: given a line and a point not on it, construct a parallel through the point using Thales (draw a transversal and mark equal distances etc.). Understand the “fourth proportional” concept in Thales context: given three segments, construct a fourth such that the set is proportional  . This ties to earlier proportion content practically. Also perhaps mention how Thales can be used to prove results (like the midline in triangle is half base and parallel – a special case of Thales).
Key Concepts and Techniques:
Thales’ Theorem: In triangle ABC, if line through C parallel to AB intersects AB’s extensions at D on AB and E on extension of AC (or something), formula: $\frac{AC}{AD} = \frac{BC}{BE} = \frac{AB}{DE}$, or internal segment form $\frac{CD}{CA} = \frac{CE}{CB}$ . The doc given shows a more general form including segment addition. But keep to simpler: if DE ∥ AB, then $\frac{CD}{DA} = \frac{CE}{EB}$ (if D, E are between A-B and A-C respectively) or the internal division form. Actually more straightforward: if parallel cuts sides, $\frac{CD}{CA} = \frac{CE}{CB}$ and $\frac{CD}{DA} = \frac{CE}{EB}$. Provide one version clearly for students.
Proof Sketch: If comfortable, mention: parallel lines imply ∠CDE = ∠CAB (corresponding angles), ∠CED = ∠CBA, thus triangles CDE ~ CAB (angle-angle) so corresponding sides proportional . This explains why the ratios hold.
Using Proportions: Show example: have triangle with a parallel segment. Label given numbers and unknown, set up ratio properly. Emphasize matching the correct sides (small triangle’s side / corresponding larger triangle’s side). Cross-multiply to solve.
Converse of Thales: If ratio holds, lines are parallel. Useful in problems: if we find two ratios equal, we can conclude a line drawn must be parallel to base. Maybe used in proofs or coordinate geometry tasks.
Triangle Similarity: Definition: two triangles similar if angles are equal (and hence sides proportional). Criteria: AAA (or two equal angles automatically third equal). Derived criteria: if sides in proportion and angles etc. If not covering formal criteria extensively, at least concept that Thales often yields one small triangle and one large share an angle and have parallel lines giving equal angles, so triangles are similar . From similarity, can get more proportional relationships, e.g. corresponding medians are in ratio, etc. Might not dive that deep.
Applications: “Shadow problems”: E.g. a stick of known height casts a shadow and a building’s shadow measured at same time, set up proportion height/shadow = height/shadow (because Sun rays parallel). Map scales: e.g. 1:50,000 means 1 cm = 500 m etc. Show using proportion or unit factor. Indirect measure: using mirror on ground (like mirror method: you see top of object in mirror at some distance, forms similar triangles with line of sight). Keep one straightforward example.
Thales in Construction: The “fourth proportional” was mentioned in doc : given lengths a, b, c, to find x such that a/b = c/x (i.e. x = bc/a). Construction: draw ray, mark segment of length a and b on it, from end of b draw a line at angle, mark c on it, draw line from end of c to end of a, then from end of b draw parallel to that line - intersection yields x. This is a known classical construction using Thales. Possibly advanced for students, but fits context. Possibly skip if not enough time.
Ensure Terms in Creole/French: Triyang semblab (similar), rapò (ratio), pwopòsyon, paralèl, etc. And Teyorèm Thalès because it’s typically known by that name.
Example Problems & Practice:
Egzanp 1: Nan △ABC, yon liy paralèl ak kote AB koupe AC nan D ak BC nan E. Si $AC = 18$ cm, $AD = 12$ cm, ak $BC = 15$ cm, kalkile $CE$. (Set CD/CA = CE/CB, but easier: AD/AC = AE/AB also or partitions. AD=12 of AC18 means D divides AC 12:6 ratio (2:1). So E divides BC in same 2:1 ratio from B, so BE = (1/2 of BC?) Actually AD:DC=12:6=2:1, so CE:EB =2:1 with BC=15 parted in 3 parts -> CE=10, EB=5. Or use direct proportion: CD = AC - AD =6, then 6/18 = CE/15 -> CE = (615)/18 =5 cm (Wait, that solves CE=5? Check: if CE=5, then EB=10, line through C parallel AB, usually smaller portion near C corresponds to smaller ratio? Let’s carefully: If AB ∥ DE, then by Thales: CD/CA = BE/BA too but we know little else. Actually easier: AD/AC = AE/AB (One version). But we don’t know AE. Better: $\frac{AD}{AC} = \frac{AE}{AB}$ or $\frac{CD}{AC} = \frac{BE}{BC}$. Let’s do second: CD = 6, AC=18, BC=15, find BE: 6/18 = BE/15 -> BE = (615)/18 = 5. So BE=5, that means from B to E is 5, so CE = BC - BE = 10. So CE=10 cm.)
Egzanp 2: Yon poto 3 m wo projete yon lonbraj 1.2 m. An menm tan, yon pyebwa projete yon lonbraj 4 m. Konbyen wotè pyebwa a? (Assume sun rays parallel, triangles sim.: height/shadow = 3/1.2 = 2.5, so tree height = 2.54 = 10 m.)*
Egzanp 3: Sou yon kat jewografik ak echèl 1:50 000, distans ant de vil mezire 3 cm. Ki distans reyèl ant yo an km? (3 cm represents 350,000 = 150,000 cm which is 1.5 km.)*
Egzanp 4: △ABC ~ △A’B’C’ (triangles semblables). Si AB = 8 cm, BC = 6 cm, CA = 10 cm; et A’B’ = 4 cm, trouve B’C’ et A’C’. (Scale factor from ABC to A’B’C’ is 4/8 = 0.5. So B’C’ = 0.5CA? Actually careful: corresponding sides: AB corresponds to A’B’ (4 vs 8 => half); BC corresponds to B’C’; CA to C’A’. So B’C’ = 0.5BC = 3 cm, A’C’ = 0.5AB? Wait AB corresponds A’B’, BC-> B’C’, CA-> C’A’. So A’C’ = 0.5AB or 0.510? Actually CA corresponds to A’C’. So A’C’ = 0.5CA = 5 cm.)
Egzanp 5: Conversely: Nan △XYZ, pwen M sou XZ ak N sou YZ tèlke $\frac{XM}{XZ} = \frac{YN}{YZ} = \frac{2}{3}$. Eske MN ∥ XY? (Yes, by Thales converse, if segments on sides are proportional, MN ∥ XY.)
Egzanp 6: Construction: Given segments of lengths 5 cm, 8 cm, 12 cm. Construct a segment x such that 5/8 = 12/x (i.e. x is fourth proportional). (Outline solution: Draw line with segment AB = 8, A to C choose length 5, draw through C a line at some angle with those lengths, mark AD =12 on that line at A, draw line DB and from C draw line ∥ DB, intersects extension of AB at E, then AE is the fourth proportional = x. Hard to fully describe in text, so likely skip detailed solution or just mention a procedure. Possibly out of scope for written answer except mentioning its possibility.)
Practice suggestions: Provide straightforward tasks: e.g. find x in simple Thales configuration diagrams. Use variety: sometimes inside triangle, sometimes extended segments. Solve similarity proportion problems for unknowns. Check understanding: give two triangles with some angles or sides and ask if they’re similar and why (like angle matches). Use mini-case: “Two towers cast shadows of lengths … find missing.” Perhaps a classic: height via mirror: if person sees top of building in mirror on ground 5m from building, person is 1.7m tall at distance maybe use similar triangles, a bit advanced but possible. Also practice conceptual: “if you double every side of a triangle, by what factor does area increase?” (should know area scales by factor^2, maybe too advanced but nice to mention in similarity context).
Mini-Quiz/Review Ideas:
Fill blanks: “If DE ∥ AB in triangle ABC, then CD/___ = CE/___.” (CD/CA = CE/CB). Or “Complete: In a triangle, a line parallel to one side cuts the other two sides in ________ lengths.” (proportional).
Proportion solve: Present a basic proportion to solve as if from Thales: e.g. 3/5 = x/10, find x. (x=6). Ensures they handle cross multiply. Possibly a quick chain: given one segment ratio, find the length.
Identify similar triangles: Draw a triangle with a parallel line inside creating smaller triangle, label triangles, ask if they’re similar and list equal angles or ratio of sides.
Yes/No: “All equilateral triangles are similar.” (Yes, all angles 60). “A 3-4-5 triangle is similar to a 6-8-10 triangle.” (Yes, side ratios match). “If ∠A = ∠D and ∠B = ∠E, then triangle ABC ∼ triangle DEF.” (True by AA). “Parallel lines always form similar small and big triangle segments.” (Often true if same angle at vertex).
Short word Q: “You measure a tree’s shadow and a meter stick’s shadow, what theorem helps find tree height?” (Thales/similar triangles due to parallel rays). “If two triangles have sides in proportion 2:3, how do their perimeters compare?” (Also 2:3).
Angle check: “What can you say about angles in two similar triangles?” (All equal respectively). “If two angles of one triangle equal two angles of another, then triangles are …?” (Similar).

Understand the definitions of basic geometric transformations: symétrie ortogonal (refleksyon aksyal) across a line, symétrie centrale about a point, translasyon by a vector, wotasyon (rotation) about a point by an angle, omoteti (scaling) from a center. Know the key characteristics of each (which preserve lengths, angles, orientation, etc.).
Construct the image of a point or simple figure under each transformation: e.g. given line ℓ and point P, construct P’ symmetric to P across ℓ (drop perpendicular, etc.) ; given center O, plot P’ as symmetric through O (such that O is midpoint of PP’) . For translation, move each point by the given vector (parallel shift) . For rotation, given center, angle and direction, rotate point P accordingly (by protractor or known constructions for 90°, etc.). For homothety, draw ray from center through point and mark scaled distance.
Recognize how compositions work: two reflections across parallel lines result in a translation (vector twice the distance between lines) ; two reflections across intersecting lines give a rotation (angle twice the angle between lines). Reflecting twice over same line returns original (involution). A translation followed by another is additive; rotation compositions add angles.
Solve simple problems using transformations: determine symmetry lines in a figure (e.g. a shape has reflective symmetry), find the result of applying one or more transformations (like image of a point after two reflections), use symmetry to simplify proofs (like showing two segments are equal by symmetry) .
Link transformations to vector algebra where possible: a translation is adding a vector, rotation by 180° around O is the same as point symmetry about O (which is like vector negation relative to O). Use homothety to handle similarity: e.g. triangle scaled by factor k yields parallel corresponding sides etc.
Key Concepts and Techniques:
Reflection (Axial Symmetry): Given line (axis) and point, if perpendicular from point to line meets at H, then image point P’ is on other side of line such that H is midpoint of PP’. If P is on the line, P’=P (line is invariant). Emphasize: reflection preserves distance, angle measure, but flips orientation (mirror image). Possibly mention notation $s_\ell(P) = P’$.
Point Symmetry (180° rotation): Equivalent to “half-turn” around center O. P’ such that O is midpoint of PP’. It’s like rotating by 180. It’s also same as translating by vector 2*(O to P). Special case: this maps lines through O to themselves but opposite, etc.
Translation: Every point moves by same vector. Properties: preserves distances and orientation (no flip). Polygons under translation remain congruent and similarly oriented. Notation $T_{\mathbf{v}}(P) = P’$.
Rotation: Need center, angle, direction (clockwise/counterclockwise). Use protractor or known angle constructions (like 90°, 60° via equilateral, etc.). It preserves lengths, angles, orientation (except possibly synonyms in orientation concept? Actually rotation keeps orientation of figure (clockwise vs anticlockwise arrangement). Show an example rotating a triangle 90° around origin on graph to build intuition.
Homothety (Scaling): Given center O and factor k: image of P is on ray OP such that OP’ = k * OP. If k > 1, enlargement; 0<k<1, reduction; k negative means point on opposite ray (through O). It preserves shape (similarity), angles preserved, lengths scaled by |k|.
Composition of Symmetries: The syllabus likely expects recognition of these important results  : reflect across line L1 then L2 (parallel lines) → translation (direction perpendicular bisector etc.). Reflect across L1 then L2 (angle between) → rotation by 2*angle between lines about intersection. Could illustrate with a simple figure. The curriculum hints: “composed of two central or two orthogonal symmetries yields something” . Indeed, two central symmetries (about O then O’) equals a translation vector = 2 * $\overrightarrow{OO’}$. Two axial symmetries with parallel axes yields translation (2 times perpendicular distance between axes). Two axial sym with axes at angle yields rotation. These are perhaps advanced but listed in suggestions .
Use in Problem Solving: Example: using symmetry to find unknown lengths or show lines parallel. E.g. reflect a point across a line to solve a distance problem (like shortest path reflecting across line method). Or show that composition of certain transformations yields known result to simplify a construction. The mention in the doc: after two symmetries see “milieux in a triangle” , probably referencing midpoint configuration. And homothety mention linking to collinear vectors and Thales , likely meaning: constructing an image by homothety highlights parallel lines and segment ratios equal (Thales).
Encourage Language: Use Creole terms: simitri, wotasyon, elajisman (for homothety maybe), translasyon. Possibly note French terms since the doc uses them (symétrie orthogonale, centrale, rotation, homothétie).
Example Problems & Practice:
Egzanp 1: Bay imaj pwen P(4, 1) nan: (a) yon simetri aksyal kote aks la se aks $x$ (horizontal line y=0). (Reflect across x-axis: image P’ = (4, -1).) (b) yon simetri santral ak sant O(0,0). (Point symmetry about origin: image P’’ = (-4, -1).)
Egzanp 2: Yon figi L rektangilè gen yon sèl aks simetri? Oswa de? (Likely asking: a general rectangle has 2 axes (through midpoints of opposite sides). If specifically not a square, yes 2. Possibly a trick: “rectangular L-shape”? Unclear. Skip if ambiguous.) Perhaps instead: “Konbyen aks simetri yon rektang genyen? e yon kare?” (Rectangle 2, square 4).
Egzanp 3: Swiv etap sa yo: pran segment AB, aplike $T_{\vec{v}}$ li (translate by vector v) pou jwenn A’B’; answit reflete A’B’ aksyalman atravè yon liy ℓ paralèl ak vektè a. Kisa konbinezon transfòmasyon sa a bay globalman? (They likely find it’s equivalent to just one translation or something. But specifically: reflection across a line parallel to translation vector yields effectively reflection then slide, which is same as slide in opposite direction then reflect maybe. Possibly too complicated; skip or reframe to simpler composition). Maybe simpler: “Reflèchi yon pwen P successivman atravè de liy paralèl ℓ1 epi ℓ2 ki distans d apa. Dekri rezilta final la.” (It will be a translation by 2d in direction perpendicular from ℓ1 to ℓ2) .
Egzanp 4: Given a triangle ABC, let M be midpoint of AB, N midpoint of AC. What is the image of segment MN under a homothety with center A and factor 2? (Since A is center, factor2, line segments from A double in length: so M and N go to points M’, N’ such that AM’ =2AM and AN’ =2AN, effectively M’, N’ are points on AB, AC s.t. AM’ = AB and AN’ = AC, thus M’ = B, N’ = C. So segment MN’s image is BC. This illustrates mid-segment -> base doubling property, connecting Thales.)
Egzanp 5: Application puzzle: “Yon pezeul: Ou gen yon triyang ak yon pwen sou youn nan kote li yo. Ki transfòmasyon ou ta ka itilize pou konstwi yon liy nan pwen sa a ki paralèl ak yon lòt kote triyang lan?” (Likely: use a central symmetry or translation. Perhaps: If point P on side AB, to draw line through P parallel to AC, one method: reflect P across midpoint of AB? Not directly. Or translate AC vector to P? Probably expecting: translation of line AC by vector AP yields a line through P parallel to AC. Yes: translasyon.)
Practice suggestions: Draw shapes and ask students to perform simple transformations using tracing paper or graph (e.g. reflect across axes, translate by a given vector, rotate 90° about origin). Ask to locate symmetry axes in given shapes (like isosceles triangle – one axis, etc.). Provide a composition scenario: e.g. reflect across two lines and ask what’s the resulting transformation (for small angles maybe they see rotation). For homothety, practice finding coordinates after scaling relative to origin or another point: e.g. scale (2,3) from origin by factor 2 -> (4,6), or from another center. A good exercise: identify transformation type from before/after pictures: e.g. shape moved but same orientation -> translation; flipped -> reflection; rotated; scaled, etc.
Mini-Quiz/Review Ideas:
Identify Transformation: Show quick drawings of a pre-image and image figure (like triangle and its mirror or rotated position) and ask which transformation occurred. Possibly multiple choice: A or B rotated?
Properties Check: “Which transformations preserve lengths? (reflection, rotation, translation do; homothety does up to scale factor, if factor=1 obviously). Which preserve orientation? (translation, rotation, homothety with positive factor; reflection flips orientation, homothety with negative factor flips).” True/False style.
Symmetry Lines: Show common figures (square, rectangle, equilateral triangle, isosceles triangle, circle) and ask how many symmetry axes each has. Or if central symmetry: e.g. parallelogram has a center of symmetry (intersection of diagonals) - T/F? (True).
Quick Construct Concept: “To reflect a point across a line, you drop a perpendicular. Yes/No?” (Yes). “To rotate a point 90° about origin in coordinate plane (x,y) becomes? (y,-x) for 90° clockwise or (-y,x) for 90° CCW).” Could ask one.
Composition Brain Teaser: “The composition of two reflections is always a rotation. Vre/Fò?” (False: parallel lines yields translation). “The composition of two homotheties with same center is another homothety with that center (factor multiplies). Vre.”
Mapping: Provide a function-like mapping scenario: “Translation by (5,0) moves (2,3) to (7,3). Where will (–1,4) go?” or “Rotation 180° about O sends (x,y) to (–x,–y). Where does (3,-5) go?” quick questions.

Understand and use the notation $a^n$ (pwisans n): repeated multiplication for positive n, reciprocal for negative n (e.g. $a^{-2} = 1/a^2$) .
Apply the laws of exponents (règ espozan) for multiplying and dividing powers (e.g. $a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n}$) and for powers of powers $(a^m)^n = a^{m \times n}$.
Define the square root (rasin kare) of a positive number as the positive number which squared gives the original (√a is such that (√a)2 = a) .
Simplify radical expressions: $\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a}\sqrt{b}$, rationalize simple denominators (e.g. rewrite $\frac{5}{\sqrt{2}}$ as $\frac{5\sqrt{2}}{2}$)  .
Solve basic equations involving squares and square roots (find x such that $x^2 = k$ or $\sqrt{x} = k$ for given k) and apply these to problem contexts.
Key Concepts and Techniques:
Exponent Basics: Illustrate small exponents with concrete meaning: $3^2 = 3 \times 3 = 9$; $2^4 = 16$. Emphasize $a^1 = a$, $a^0 = 1$ (for $a \neq 0$). Negative exponents introduced as reciprocals: e.g. $2^{-3} = 1/2^3 = 1/8$. Use patterns to justify these rules (like halving each time when exponent decreases by 1). Connect to prior knowledge of reciprocals in proportional contexts.
Rules of Calculation with Exponents: Derive and practice $a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}$, $\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}$, and $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$. Use numerical examples in Kreyòl for clarity: egzanp: $2^3 \times 2^4 = 2^7$; $(5^2)^3 = 5^6$. Caution on different bases: $2^3 \cdot 3^3 \neq 6^3$ (they must recognize when rules apply).
Square Roots: Define $\sqrt{a}$ as nimewo ki lè ou miltipliye li pa li menm bay a for $a \ge 0$ . Explain notation: $\sqrt{25} = 5$ (principal square root). Reinforce that $\sqrt{a}$ is defined as non-negative. Show that if $x^2 = a$ then $x = ±√a$ (introducing the idea of two solutions, but principal root being positive). Compare square and square root as inverse operations for positive numbers.
Properties of Radicals: Demonstrate simplifying: $\sqrt{16 \times 2} = \sqrt{16}\sqrt{2} = 4\sqrt{2}$. Encourage students to express answers in simplest form (e.g. $\sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}$). Teach rationalizing denominators with one radical: multiply numerator and denominator by the radical: e.g. $\frac{5}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{3}$ . Explain why this is done (to get rid of radicals in denominators, a common convention).
Absolute Value Link: Note that $\sqrt{a^2} = |a|$. For example, $\sqrt{(-4)^2} = 4$. Use this to solve equations like $x^2 = 9$ (x = ±3) and check understanding that $\sqrt{9} = 3$ (not –3).
Applications: Show how exponents appear in area/volume formulas (square units, cubic units), scientific notation (e.g. the population of Haiti ~ $1.17 \times 10^7$). Use a simple physics context like computing kinetic energy ($E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$) to see a square, or distance formula in plane $d = \sqrt{\Delta x^2 + \Delta y^2}$. These examples reinforce why learning to handle powers and roots is useful.
Example Problems & Practice:
Egzanp 1: Konvèti epi senplifye: $2^3 \times 2^{-2} \times 2^4$. (Answer: $2^{3-2+4} = 2^5 = 32$.)
Egzanp 2: Jwenn rezilta a: $(3^2)^3 \div 3^4$. (Simplify: $(3^2)^3 = 3^6$, then $3^6 \div 3^4 = 3^{6-4} = 3^2 = 9$.)
Egzanp 3: Ekwasyon: $x^2 = 49$. Jwenn x. (Answer: $x = ±7$; if phrased in context like length, take positive 7.)
Egzanp 4: Senplifye radikal yo: $\sqrt{50}$, $\sqrt{18} + \sqrt{8}$. (Expected: $\sqrt{50} = 5\sqrt{2}$; $\sqrt{18}+ \sqrt{8} = 3\sqrt{2} + 2\sqrt{2} = 5\sqrt{2}$.)
Egzanp 5: Rasyonalize denominatè a: $\frac{4}{\sqrt{5}}$. (Multiply by √5/√5 to get $ \frac{4\sqrt{5}}{5}$.)
Egzanp 6: Konpare: Ki pi gran, $3\sqrt{5}$ oswa $7$? (Square both or approximate: $3√5 ≈ 3×2.236 = 6.708$ < 7, so 7 is bigger.)
Practice suggestions: Simplify various expressions using exponent rules (mix of multiplying and dividing powers). Evaluate expressions with negative exponents: e.g. $2^{-1} + 2^{-2}$ (should convert to fractions). For radicals, provide a mix of perfect squares and non-perfect squares to simplify. Ask students to rationalize denominators like $1/(2+√3)$ (introducing the idea of multiplying by the conjugate for advanced practice). Also include some contextual problems: e.g. find the side of a square with area 50 m² (√50, simplified to $5√2$ m); use the Pythagorean theorem to find a missing side and express the answer in simplest radical form if needed.
Mini-Quiz/Review Ideas:
Exponent Law Check: A 5-question quiz on exponent rules: e.g. “If $a^5 \times a^n = a^7$, what is n?”; “True or False: $(2^3)^4 = 2^7$” (false, should be $2^{12}$). Include a mix of conceptual and numeric items.
Flashcards: Students get flashcards with expressions like $7^{-2}$ or $\sqrt{32}$ and must quickly give the simplified result ($\frac{1}{49}$, $4\sqrt{2}$ respectively). This encourages mental recall of common simplifications.
Matching Pairs: One set of cards has radical expressions, another has their simplified forms (e.g. card A: $\sqrt{72}$, card B: $6\sqrt{2}$). Students match them, racing in small groups.
“Which is larger?” Game: List pairs of expressions (like $2^4$ vs $4^2$; $5\sqrt{3}$ vs $9$; $3^{-3}$ vs $3^{-2}$) and have students choose the larger. They must justify their choice briefly, reinforcing understanding of magnitude with exponents and roots.
Real-life Connections: Include one quick question about scientific notation or area: e.g. “Express 0.00045 in scientific notation” or “If a square has area $16x^2$ (square meters), what is the length of one side? (Answer: $4x$ meters, showing understanding of square root of a square term).”

Physics,NSII,Chapter 1: Light and Optics (Limyè ak Optik),Dispèsyon Limyè ak Lakansyèl (Dispersion of Light and the Rainbow),"Learning Objectives:
Understand that white light is composed of many colors (wavelengths) that can be separated.
Describe dispèsyon (dispersion) as the separation of light into colors by refraction.
Explain how a lakansyèl (rainbow) forms through dispersion and reflection of sunlight in raindrops.
Key Concepts:
Dispèsyon limyè: When light refracts, different colors (frequencies) bend by different amounts  . Shorter wavelengths (blue/violet) slow down more and bend more than longer wavelengths (red) in a given medium  . This causes white light to spread out into a spectrum of colors.
Prizm (prisme): A glass prism can disperse white light into its constituent colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet). The prism refracts each color differently , producing a mini-rainbow.
Lakansyèl (arc-en-ciel): In nature, rainbows occur when sunlight enters water droplets in the air – light refracts entering the droplet, reflects inside on the back of the droplet, and refracts again when leaving. This double refraction and internal reflection separate the colors, creating a circular rainbow .
Experiment:
Prizm white light demo: Shine a beam of white light (from a flashlight or sunlight through a small slit) into a glass prism in a darkened room. Project the spectrum onto a white surface. Students observe the band of colors. They can identify the order of colors (red bends least, violet most). (Label: Eksperyans: Fè eksperyans prizm pou separe limyè blan an nan koulè yo.)*
CD/DVD as prism: Alternatively, use a DVD or CD – its grooves act like a diffraction grating (another way to disperse light) – to show rainbow patterns when light reflects off it. Compare this diffraction pattern to prism dispersion.
Quiz/Activity:
Matching: Pair each color with how much it bends in a prism. (e.g., Red – bends least; Violet – bends most). Students match or order the colors from least refracted to most refracted.
Question: “Pouki lakansyèl gen fòm yon banza nan syèl la?” (Why does a rainbow appear as an arc in the sky?) – Answer Hint: Because we see only the droplets at a specific angle (about 42° for red, 40° for violet) relative to our eye and the sun, which forms a circular arc of dispersed light."
Physics,NSII,Chapter 1: Light and Optics (Limyè ak Optik),Entwodiksyon a Limyè ak Refleksyon (Introduction to Light and Reflection),"Learning Objectives:
Understand that light propagates in straight lines in homogenous media.
Explain the law of reflection (lwa refleksyon) – the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.
Identify examples of reflection in everyday life (mirrors, smooth water surfaces).
Key Concepts:
Pwopagasyon rektilinyè (straight-line propagation): Light travels in straight paths and forms shadows when blocked.
Refleksyon limyè (reflection of light): When light hits a reflective surface, it bounces back at an equal angle. Mirrors produce images by reflection.
Ang enkidans ak ang refleksyon (angle of incidence and reflection): The incoming ray and reflected ray make equal angles with the normal (an imaginary line perpendicular to the surface).
Experiment:
Shine a flashlight at a small mirror in a dark room to observe the reflected beam path. Use a protractor to measure the incident and reflected angles on a piece of paper – they should be equal. (Label in Creole: Eksperyans: Sèvi ak yon flach ak yon glas pou mezire ang enkidans ak refleksyon.)*
Another demo: Stand in front of a mirror and use a laser pointer (carefully) to see how the light reflects directly back at the same angle.
Quiz/Activity:
Draw a diagram of a light ray hitting a mirror and mark the angles. Ask: “Si ang enkidans lan se 30°, ki valè ang refleksyon an?” (If the incidence angle is 30°, what is the reflection angle?) – Answer: 30°.

Physics,NSII,Chapter 1: Light and Optics (Limyè ak Optik),Lantiy ak Enstriman Optik (Lenses and Optical Instruments),"Learning Objectives:
Distinguish between lantiy konvèjan (converging/convex lens) and lantiy divèjan (diverging/concave lens).
Understand how a convex lens forms real images (e.g., focusing light to a point) and a concave lens causes light to spread.
Describe basic optical instruments (the eye, a magnifying glass, a camera, a telescope) and how they use lenses and/or mirrors.
Key Concepts:
Lantiy (lentille): A lens is a transparent object with curved surfaces that refracts light. Convex lenses (bòdi konvèks) are thicker at the center and fè reyon limyè konvèje (bring light rays together) to a focus. Concave lenses (bòdi konkav) are thinner at the center and fè reyon limyè dispèse (spread light rays apart).
Imaj reyèl ak imaj vityèl: A convex lens can produce a real image (imaj reyèl) on a screen (e.g., focusing sunlight to a spot, or projecting an image upside down), whereas a concave lens only produces a virtual image (imaj vityèl) that can be seen by looking through the lens (smaller, upright image).
Enstriman optik:
Je moun (œil): The eye has a natural convex lens that focuses light on the retina. Nearsightedness/Farsightedness can be corrected with lenses (concave for myopia, convex for hyperopia).
Loup (loupe) / Mikwoskòp: A magnifying glass (simple microscope) is a convex lens that creates a magnified virtual image when the object is within the focal length.
Telescope (teleskòp) ak kamera: Use combinations of lenses (and/or mirrors) to form images of distant objects. A telescope uses an objective lens (or mirror) to form a real image and an eyepiece lens to magnify it. A camera uses a convex lens to focus an image onto a sensor or film (like an eye on a screen).
Experiment:
Focusing light with a lens: Take a convex lens (e.g., a magnifying glass) outdoors on a sunny day. Hold it above a sheet of paper and adjust the distance until the sunlight focuses to a small bright spot. Observe that this spot is actually an image of the sun. (Be careful – the focused light can burn the paper if held too long.) This shows how a convex lens converges light to its focal point. (Label: Eksperyans: Itilize yon lantiy konvèks pou konsantre limyè solèy la sou yon fèy papye.)*
Apparent depth demo: Place a coin at the bottom of an empty cup. Back away until you just cannot see the coin beyond the rim, then have someone slowly fill the cup with water while you keep your eyes at the same level. Suddenly the coin becomes visible. This is because the water and glass act as a lens, bending light from the coin into your eyes – a simple lens effect similar to apparent depth.
Quiz/Activity:
Labeling diagram: Provide a diagram of a convex lens focusing light from an object. Have students label the fwaye (focal point), aks optik (optical axis), and indicate where the image forms.
Short answer: “Ki diferans ant yon ‘imaj reyèl’ ak yon ‘imaj vityèl’, e kilès nan yo yon lantiy konvèks ka pwodui?” (What is the difference between a real image and a virtual image, and which ones can a convex lens produce?) – Expected: A real image can be projected on a screen (light actually converges there) while a virtual image cannot be formed on a screen (it only appears behind the lens). A convex lens can produce a real image if the object is outside the focal length, or a virtual magnified image if the object is inside the focal length."
Physics,NSII,Chapter 1: Light and Optics (Limyè ak Optik),Refleksyon Entèn Total ak Fenomèn li yo (Total Internal Reflection and Its Phenomena),"Learning Objectives:
Explain what refleksyon entèn total (total internal reflection) is and when it occurs.
Define the critical angle (ang kritik) for a light passing from a denser to a rarer medium.
Identify real-world examples of total internal reflection (e.g., fiber optics, mirages).
Key Concepts:
Refleksyon entèn total: When light tries to pass from a denser medium to a less dense medium at a steep angle, it can be completely reflected back inside rather than refracted. This happens if the angle of incidence is greater than a certain ang kritik (critical angle).
Ang kritik: The minimum angle of incidence for which total internal reflection occurs. Beyond this angle, no refraction out; all light is reflected internally. (For water-air, ~48°; for glass-air ~42°).
Aplikasyon pratik: Optical fibers use total internal reflection to trap light and guide it through cables. Diamonds sparkle due to multiple internal reflections (high refractive index yields small critical angle). Mirages in deserts or hot roads are partly due to light bending and reflecting in layers of air (gradual refraction simulating TIR).
Experiment:
Use a transparent acrylic or glass semicircular block. Shine a laser from the flat side and increase the incidence angle inside the block. Observe the light exiting until a point where no light exits and it all reflects inside – that’s total internal reflection. Mark the approximate angle this occurs (critical angle). (Label: Eksperyans: Thorne yon reyon lazè nan yon blòk vè demi-wonn; jwenn ang kritik kote pa gen limyè ki sòti.)*
Virtual demo: Use a simulation or applet (if available) to show a ray in a prism or fiber and adjust angles to see total internal reflection in action.
Quiz/Activity:
True/False: “Refleksyon entèn total rive lè yon reyon limyè ale soti nan dlo pou nan lè epi ang enkidans lan piti pase ang kritik la.” (Total internal reflection happens when light goes from water to air and the incidence angle is smaller than the critical angle.) – Answer: False (angle must be greater than critical angle).
Ask: “Kisa ki fè fib optik yo kenbe limyè a san l pa soti?” (What makes optical fibers keep light from escaping?) – Expected: Total internal reflection of light within the fiber’s core."
Physics,NSII,Chapter 1: Light and Optics (Limyè ak Optik),Refraksyon Limyè – Limyè Ki Fèt Kase (Light Refraction – Bending of Light),"Learning Objectives:
Define refraksyon (refraction) as the bending of light when it passes from one medium to another .
Understand that refraction occurs due to change in light’s speed in different materials .
Predict the direction light bends (toward or away from the normal) depending on the optical density of the medium.
Key Concepts:
Refraksyon (Réfraction): The change in direction of a light ray when it passes from one transparent medium to another and its speed changes . For example, light slows down in water or glass, causing it to bend.
Dans optik mwayen (optical density): A medium like glass or water has a higher refractive index than air, so light travels slower in it. Light entering a denser medium bends toward the normal, and entering a less dense medium bends away from the normal .
Lwa Snell-Descartes (Snell’s Law): Quantitatively, n₁ · sinθ₁ = n₂ · sinθ₂ (mention in French for reference), relating angles and refractive indices. (Students learn the concept qualitatively; formula use is optional).
Experiment:
Bented pay nan dlo: Place a straw or pencil in a glass of water and observe from the side. The straw appears bent or broken at the water surface because of refraction . Mark the apparent position of the straw versus its actual position to visualize the bending. (Label: Eksperyans: Gade yon pay nan yon vè dlo; obsève jan li parèt kase.)*
Use a rectangular glass block: Shine a ray of laser light into it and trace the incoming and outgoing beams on paper. Measure the bending angle. This helps visualize how light path deviates inside the glass.
Quiz/Activity:
Fill in the blank (in Creole/French mix): “Refraksyon rive lè limyè chanje ______ lè li pase soti nan yon mwayen pou yon lòt.” (Refraction occurs when light changes ______ as it goes from one medium to another.) – Expected answer: vitès (speed).
Ask students to predict: “Èske yon reyon limyè ap pliye pi pre nòmal la lè li antre nan dlo depi nan lè, oswa lè li sòti nan dlo al nan lè?” (Will a light ray bend closer to the normal when entering water from air, or when exiting water to air?) – Answer: Closer to the normal when entering water (denser medium), away from normal when exiting to air."
Physics,NSII,Chapter 2: Electrical Circuits (Sikwi Elektrik),Efè Joule ak Pouvwa Elektwik (Joule’s Effect and Electric Power),"Learning Objectives:
Describe efè Joule – the heating effect of electric current (why resistors, wires, appliances warm up when current passes).
State Lwa Joule: the heat produced H in a resistor by current I in time t is H = I² · R · t (formula for advanced understanding), and qualitatively, higher current or resistance means more heat.
Define pouvwa elektwik (puissance électrique) and relate it to voltage and current: P = V · I (in watts, W). Also know energy consumed E = P · t (in joules or kilowatt-hours).
Recognize practical implications: why light bulbs, phone chargers, irons, etc., get hot (Joule heating), and how to calculate power of devices (like a 60 W bulb draws certain current).
Key Concepts:
Efè Joule (Effet Joule): As current flows through a resistor or any device with resistance, electrical energy is converted to heat  . Examples: a wire gets warm, a light bulb filament glows white-hot (producing light), an electric stove or fè a repase (clothes iron) heats up due to current flow . Joule’s law (in words): the heat produced is proportional to the square of the current, the resistance, and the time of flow. This means even a small increase in current can greatly increase heat (important for not overloading wires).
Pouvwa (Puissance): The rate of energy conversion or the work done per second. In electrical terms, P = V × I. Also, using Ohm’s law, P can be expressed as P = I²R or P = V²/R. A device’s wattage tells how much energy it uses per second. For example, a 100 W bulb uses energy faster (and likely brighter/hotter) than a 40 W bulb.
Enèji elektrik: Measured in joules (J) in physics, but often in watt-hours or kilowatt-hours (kWh) for household electricity. 1 kWh = 3.6×10^6 J. This is the energy used when consuming 1000 W for 1 hour. Knowing energy and power helps in understanding electricity bills, battery life, etc.
Randman (Rendement/efficiency): Not all electrical energy becomes desired form (like light in a bulb); much is lost as heat (Joule effect). Efficiency = useful output energy / input energy (or output power/input power). This concept ties in with energy conversion in Chapter 5, but it’s good to mention that Joule heating is often waste heat in electronics (except where heat is intended, like toasters).
Experiment:
Joule heating demo: Feel the warmth of a resistor: set up a simple circuit with a battery and a fil rezistan (resistance wire) or a small 6V incandescent bulb. Let it run for a minute, then carefully touch the resistor or bulb (caution: it might be hot, ensure it’s safe). Students will notice it’s warm – evidence of electrical energy dissipated as heat. (Label: Eksperyans: Obsève chofaj yon fil oswa yon anpoul piti lè kouran pase ladan li – efè Joule.)*
Electric heater model: If available, show a piece of nichrome wire (from a hair dryer or toaster) connected to a battery. It will get hot and possibly glow red. Use low voltage/high current source for a few seconds to illustrate. Alternatively, use a multimeter to measure current and calculate power dissipated (P = V×I) in the wire and relate to heat felt.
Mezi pouvwa: Using a multimeter, measure the voltage across and current through a bulb (for example, a flashlight bulb). Compute P = V×I. Compare this to the bulb’s rated wattage. This reinforces the concept of power.
Quiz/Activity:
Question: “Ki rezon ki fè yon fil elektrik chofe lè gen twòp kouran ki pase ladan li?” (Why does an electric wire heat up when too much current flows through it?) – Answer: Because of Joule’s effect: moving charges collide with atoms in the wire, converting electrical energy into heat. Higher current means more collisions and more heat.
Calculation: A 12 V car headlight draws 3 A. What is its power consumption? (P = V×I = 12×3 = 36 W). How much energy in joules does it use in 5 seconds? (E = P×t = 36×5 = 180 J).
True/False: “Si ou double vòltaj yon rezistans pandan ou kenbe rezistans la menm, pouvwa a ki depanse nan rezistans lan ap ogmante kat fwa.” (If you double the voltage across a resistor while keeping the resistance same, the power dissipated increases by four times.) – Answer: True (because P = V²/R, doubling V quadruples P).
Brainstorm: List 3 devices where Joule heating is useful (e.g., electric heater, toaster, incandescent bulb) and 3 devices where it’s a by-product to be minimized (e.g., computer chips, LED bulbs, phone chargers)."
Physics,NSII,Chapter 2: Electrical Circuits (Sikwi Elektrik),Konpozan ak Dyagram Sikwi (Circuit Components and Diagrams),"Learning Objectives:
Identify basic components of an electric circuit: pile/batri (battery), fil elektrik (wires), anpoul (bulb/lamp), switch (interrupteur), rezistans (resistor), etc.
Understand the concept of a closed circuit (sikwi fèmen) vs an open circuit (sikwi louvri), and why a closed loop is required for current to flow.
Read and draw simple circuit diagrams using standard symbols (battery, resistor, lamp, switch).
Key Concepts:
Kouran elektrik kontini (DC current): A flow of electric charge (electrons) in one direction around a circuit, from the positive terminal of the battery around to the negative.
Sikwi elektrik senp: A simple circuit might consist of a battery, a connecting wire, and a bulb. When connected in a loop (closed circuit), current flows and the bulb lights. If there is any break (open circuit), current stops and the bulb goes off.
Konduktè vs Izolan: Conductors (e.g., copper wire) allow current to flow easily, while insulators (plastic, rubber) do not. (Recall from NS I: students distinguished conductors and insulators  .) Wires are metal (conductor) with plastic insulation.
Schémas électriques: Standard symbols are used: a long and short line pair for a battery (pile), zigzag for resistor, circle with X or loop for a bulb, and a break with a line for a switch. Being able to interpret these diagrams is crucial for building and analyzing circuits.
Experiment:
Battery-bulb connection: Give students a battery, a small light bulb, and a piece of wire. Challenge them to make the bulb light up with these items. (They should discover that touching one end of the wire from battery positive to bulb, and the other end of bulb to battery negative closes the circuit.) Then introduce a switch or a second wire to build a proper loop circuit with a switch to turn the bulb on/off. (Label: Eksperyans: Fè yon anpoul limen ak yon pile ak fil elektrik.)*
Have them draw the circuit diagram for their setup. Compare their drawing with the standard schematic. This reinforces understanding of symbols and real components.
Quiz/Activity:
Diagram quiz: Provide a simple circuit diagram with a battery, two wires, and a lamp. Ask students to identify each symbol in Creole/French (e.g., “Ki siy sa a reprezante?” pointing to the battery symbol – expected answer: “Yon batri (pile électrique)”).
True/False: “Si gen yon espas nan sikwi a, kouran elektrik la ap koule kanmenm.” (If there is a gap in the circuit, current will still flow.) – Answer: False.
Fill in the blank: “Materyèl ki pèmèt kouran pase yo rele ______, epi materyèl ki anpeche kouran yo rele ______.” (Materials that allow current to pass are called ______, and materials that prevent current are called ______.) – Answer: konduktè (conductors), izolan (insulators)."
Physics,NSII,Chapter 2: Electrical Circuits (Sikwi Elektrik),"Lwa Ohm – Relasyon ant Vòltaj, Kouran, ak Rezistans (Ohm’s Law: Relationship between Voltage, Current, and Resistance)","Learning Objectives:
State Ohm’s Law (Lwa Ohm): the current through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage across it and inversely proportional to the resistance . In formula form: I = U/R (with I = current, U = voltage, R = resistance).
Understand the units: Voltage in volts (V), Current in amperes (A), Resistance in ohms (Ω).
Use Ohm’s law to solve simple problems (e.g., given two of V, I, R, find the third). Also plot a simple I–V graph for an ohmic resistor (straight line through origin).
Key Concepts:
Vòltaj (Tansyon elektrik): The electrical “pressure” provided by a battery or power source that pushes charges through a circuit. Symbol V (also E or U in formulas). It’s the difference in electric potential between two points .
Kouran (Entansite kouran): The flow rate of electric charge in the circuit. Symbol I. 1 ampere = 1 coulomb of charge per second (though coulomb concept might be advanced; focus qualitatively).
Rezistans: A property of a material or component that resists the flow of current. Symbol R. A resistor converts electrical energy to heat (per Joule’s law) – more on that later.
Ohm’s Law: I = V/R. This means if you increase voltage, current increases (for a given resistance); if you increase resistance, current decreases . For an ohmic conductor (resistance constant), the I–V relationship is linear . The MENFP curriculum includes verifying Ohm’s law experimentally  .
Experiment:
Mesure V ak I nan yon sikwi: Build a simple circuit with a battery, a resistor (or a small lamp), and an ammeter in series to measure current. Also use a voltmeter across the resistor. Vary the voltage by using different batteries (e.g., 1.5 V, 3 V, 4.5 V by series cells)  . For each voltage, record the current. Students will observe that doubling the voltage roughly doubles the current – confirming Ohm’s law . They can plot a graph of I (x-axis) vs V (y-axis) and see a straight line through the origin . (Label: Eksperyans: Monte yon ti sikwi ak yon rezistans; mezire entansite kouran pou diferan vòltaj pou verifye lwa Ohm  .)*
If no ammeter/voltmeter available, use a pre-marked resistor and theoretical values: measure battery voltage with a multimeter and use known R to predict current; or use simulation tools (like PhET simulator for Ohm’s law).
Quiz/Activity:
Simple calculation: “Si yon rezistans R = 5 Ω sou yon batri 10 V, kalkile kouran an (I).” – Answer: I = 10 V / 5 Ω = 2 A.
Ohm’s law triangle: Provide a triangle diagram with V on top, I and R at bottom corners (magic triangle). Ask students to fill in the formulas for V, I, R (V = I×R, I = V/R, R = V/I).
True/False: “Kouran an ogmante si nou ogmante rezistans la, pandan vòltaj la fiks.” (Current increases if we increase resistance, with voltage fixed.) – Answer: False (current decreases with more resistance, per I = V/R)."
Physics,NSII,Chapter 2: Electrical Circuits (Sikwi Elektrik),Sekirite ak Aplikasyon Pratik (Electrical Safety and Practical Applications),"Learning Objectives:
Recognize common applications of electric circuits and the importance of circuit design (series vs parallel) in real life (e.g., house wiring is in parallel so each appliance gets full voltage).
Understand basic electrical safety principles: why fuses or circuit breakers are used, the danger of short circuits (kout-sikwi), and precautions to avoid shocks or overloads.
Apply knowledge of power and energy to practical calculations (e.g., determine the cost of operating an appliance given its power rating and usage time).
Key Concepts:
Rezo elektrik kay (house wiring): In home wiring, all outlets and lights are in parallel across the mains voltage. This ensures each appliance operates at the standard voltage (e.g., 110 V or 220 V). If one device is turned off or fails, it doesn’t shut off others (unlike series).
Surchof ak kout-sikwi: A short circuit is an unintended low-resistance path (like when a positive wire touches negative directly). It causes a huge current because R ≈ 0, which can lead to extreme Joule heating and fire. Fuses and breakers are safety devices that “open” the circuit if current is too high, preventing overheating  . Overloading an outlet with too many devices (in parallel) can similarly draw excessive current – safety devices trip to cut power.
Tè (mise à la terre/grounding): Many appliances have a ground wire (third prong) which is a safety path to earth in case a hot wire touches the metal case – it directs current to ground and triggers breaker, protecting the user from shock. Students should know not to remove ground pins or handle electrical devices with wet hands, etc.
Kalkil konsomasyon: Knowing power ratings, one can calculate energy use. For example, a chodyè elektrik (electric kettle) of 1000 W used for 0.5 hour uses 0.5 kWh. If electricity costs X gourdes per kWh, one can find the cost. This ties physics to practical life and encourages energy conservation awareness.
Experiment/Activity:
Fuse demo (teacher-led): Show how a thin fuse wire melts if too much current flows. Set up a simple circuit with a battery, a low-value resistor (or a nearly short circuit) and include a strand of fine steel wool or a thin copper wire as a makeshift fuse. When connected briefly, the wire should heat and burn out, breaking the circuit. (Safety: perform with eye protection and away from flammable materials.) This dramatic demo reinforces why fuses are used. (Label: Eksperyans: Demontre yon fuse kap fonn pou koupe sikwi lè kouran an twòp.)*
Appliance power check: If possible, use a watt-meter device to measure how much power common appliances draw (or simply read labels: e.g., phone charger 5 W, iron 1200 W). Have students list these and discuss which devices use a lot of electricity and should not all run on one outlet strip (to avoid overload).
Simulated house circuit: Draw a simple “house” diagram with a breaker, several parallel branches for lights and outlets. Perhaps use a low-voltage battery and small lamps to mimic it physically. Discuss what happens if one lamp is removed (others stay on – parallel) and what happens if a “short” is introduced (battery gets hot or wires, representing why a breaker is needed).
Quiz/Activity:
Scenario: “Ou gen yon multi-tap konekte ak yon frijidè (300 W), yon mikwo-onn (1200 W), ak yon televizyon (100 W) tout an menm tan. Si liy elektrik la sipòte sèlman 1500 W, kisa ki ka rive?” (You have a power strip with a fridge 300 W, microwave 1200 W, TV 100 W all at once. If the circuit supports only 1500 W, what might happen?) – Expected: The total load is 1600 W, which exceeds 1500 W; this may trip a breaker or blow a fuse due to overcurrent, cutting power for safety (or if safety fails, wires could overheat – fire hazard).
True/False: “Yon kout-sikwi se lè yon aparèy nan kay la sote (fè fay) epi kouran an sispann koule.” (A short circuit is when a home appliance blows and current stops flowing.) – Answer: False (a short circuit is a direct connection of live to neutral/ground causing excessive current; a blown fuse or tripped breaker stops the current as a result).
Ask: “Poukisa tout ekipman nan yon kay branche an paralèl, pa an seri?” (Why is all equipment in a house wired in parallel, not series?) – Expected Answers: In parallel each device gets full voltage and can operate independently. In series they would share voltage and one failure would shut all off."
Physics,NSII,Chapter 2: Electrical Circuits (Sikwi Elektrik),Seri ak Paralèl – Konparezon Sikwi (Series vs Parallel Circuits),"Learning Objectives:
Distinguish between konfigirasyon an seri (series configuration) and an paralèl (parallel configuration) for circuit elements.
Determine how current and voltage behave in series vs parallel circuits: series circuits have one path (same current through all components, voltage splits), parallel circuits have multiple paths (same voltage across branches, current splits).
Calculate equivalent resistance for simple series and parallel combinations of resistors.
Key Concepts:
Sikwi an seri: Components connected end-to-end in a single loop. Characteristics: the menm kouran (same current) flows through each component (no branching). The total voltage from the source is divided across components (voltage drops add up). The equivalent resistance R_eq is the sum of each resistance (R_total = R1 + R2 + …). If one element breaks or is disconnected, the whole circuit stops (like old Christmas lights in series – one burnout, all go out).
Sikwi an paralèl: Components connected so that they share both terminals – forming branches. Characteristics: menm vòltaj (same voltage) is applied across each branch (directly connected to the source). The total current from the source splits between branches (and recombines). The equivalent resistance is given by 1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + … – which results in R_total being less than any individual resistance. In a parallel circuit, if one branch is broken, current can still flow in others (e.g., modern Christmas lights – one out, rest stay lit).
Egzanp: Two bulbs in series will be dimmer (sharing the battery voltage) and if one bulb is removed, both go out. Two bulbs in parallel each get full battery voltage so are brighter (each draws current) and removing one doesn’t affect the other. The curriculum expects students to experiment with these configurations .
Experiment:
Build series and parallel bulb circuits: Using wires, a battery, and two small light bulbs (plus holders), first connect the bulbs in series (one after the other). Observe brightness. Then connect them in parallel (each bulb directly to battery terminals via separate paths). Observe brightness differences. Use a multimeter or ammeter if available to measure current in each case: series circuit current is the same through both bulbs; parallel circuit total current = sum of currents in each branch (which is higher than series current). (Label: Eksperyans: Konpare de anpoul an seri vs an paralèl: obsève briyans ak mezire kouran.)*
Equivalent resistance demo: Use known resistors (e.g., two 100 Ω resistors). Measure the total resistance when they are in series (should be ~200 Ω) and in parallel (should be ~50 Ω) with a multimeter. This confirms formula predictions.
Quiz/Activity:
Ask: “Nan ki sikwi ampoul yo ap klere plis – an seri oswa an paralèl (sou menm batri)?” (In which circuit will bulbs glow brighter – series or parallel, on the same battery?) – Answer: Parallel, because each gets full voltage.
Problem: Given R1 = 6 Ω and R2 = 3 Ω, battery 9 V. If they are in series, what is the total resistance and current? (R_total=9 Ω, I = 9V/9Ω = 1 A). If in parallel, what is total resistance and current? (R_total = (1/6+1/3)^-1 = 2 Ω, I = 9V/2Ω = 4.5 A). – This shows how parallel draws more current (lower resistance).
True/False: “Nan yon sikwi paralèl, vòltaj la diferan sou chak branch.” (In a parallel circuit, the voltage is different across each branch.) – Answer: False (voltage is the same across all branches in parallel)."
Physics,NSII,Chapter 3: Electrostatics (Elektrostatik),Chaj Elektrik ak Estrikti Atòm (Electric Charge and Atomic Structure),"Learning Objectives:
Recall the structure of an atom: nucleus (protons + neutrons) and electrons.
Understand that protons carry positive charge (+), electrons carry negative charge (–), and neutrons are neutral.
Explain that most objects are neutral normally (equal positive and negative charges), and charging involves adding or removing electrons.
Key Concepts:
Estrikti atòm: Atoms consist of a small, positively charged nucleus (with protons and neutrons) and electrons moving around it. Protons (p+) have positive charge, electrons (e–) have equal-magnitude negative charge, neutrons (n°) have no charge. In a neutral atom, #protons = #electrons, so charges balance.
Chaj elektrik (Charge électrique): Measured in coulombs (C) in SI units. An electron has charge –1.6×10^-19 C, a proton +1.6×10^-19 C. We often talk about charges in terms of number of electrons excess or deficit. Charge is conserved – it can be transferred but not created or destroyed.
Kò neut (Corps neutre) vs kò chaje: A neutral object has no net charge. An object becomes negatively charged if it gains extra electrons, or positively charged if it loses electrons (thus having more protons than electrons remaining). In Creole: “Kò ki gen plis elektwon pase pwoton gen chaj negatif; si li gen mwens elektwon pase pwoton, li chaje pozitif.”
Notation: We can denote charge states as Q = +nC or –nC (coulombs). But at this level, focus on qualitative: “positively charged” vs “negatively charged” vs “neutral”.
Experiment:
Electroscope (simple): Make a simple electroscope using a glass jar, a metal coat-hanger wire, and two small strips of aluminum foil attached to the wire inside the jar. When a charged object touches or comes near the metal top of the wire, the foil leaves diverge because they receive like charge and repel. Students can charge a balloon or comb and see the leaves move without touching (induction effect) and even more if touching (conduction). (Label: Eksperyans: Fè yon elektwoskòp senp pou detekte chaj elektrik.)*
Balloon and paper: Classic activity – rub a balloon on hair or wool (balloon gains electrons, becoming negatively charged). Then bring it near small bits of paper or styrofoam. The balloon will attract the neutral bits (induced polarization) and pick them up. Also try sticking the charged balloon to a wall – it will adhere for a while due to attraction of opposite induced charge in the wall. This demonstrates electrostatic attraction.
Quiz/Activity:
Fill in the blanks: “Pwoton gen chaj ______, elektwon gen chaj ______, epi netwon ______.” (Proton has ____ charge, electron has ____ charge, neutron ____) – Answer: pozitif, negatif, pa gen chaj (zero).
True/False: “Lè yon baton plastik fwote ak twal, yo toude vin chaje ak menm kalite chaj.” (When a plastic rod is rubbed with cloth, both become charged with the same type of charge.) – Answer: False (they get opposite charges; one gains electrons to be negative, the other loses to be positive).
Ask: “Ki patikil subatomik ki deplase pou kreye chaj sou yon objè?” (Which subatomic particle moves to create charge on an object?) – Expected: Electrons (because they are mobile; protons are bound in nuclei and generally don’t move between objects in everyday static charging)."
Physics,NSII,Chapter 3: Electrostatics (Elektrostatik),"Elektrizasyon – Fwotman, Kontak, Endiksyon (Charging Methods: Friction, Conduction, Induction)","Learning Objectives:
Demonstrate charging by friction (elektrizasyon pa fwotman): how rubbing two different materials can transfer electrons from one to the other (triboelectric effect).
Explain charging by conduction (pa kontak): touching a charged object to a neutral conductor transfers some charge.
Explain charging by induction (pa endiksyon): bringing a charged object near a conductor can induce charge separation without direct contact, and how grounding can permanently charge the object oppositely.
Key Concepts:
Elektrizasyon pa fwotman (Chargement par frottement): When certain materials are rubbed, one material’s atoms attract electrons more strongly than the other’s. For example, rubbing a plastic rod with wool: electrons transfer from wool to plastic, leaving plastic negatively charged and wool positive. Seri triboelektrik: A list of materials indicating which tends to gain or lose electrons (not necessary to memorize, but examples help: glass rubbed with silk – glass loses electrons and becomes positive, silk gains and becomes negative). Students have observed this with comb and hair, balloon and sweater, etc.
Elektrizasyon pa kontak (Conduction): If a charged object touches a neutral conductor, some charge spreads to the conductor. After contact, both objects share the total charge (redistributed). For instance, a charged rod touching an electroscope will transfer charge to it, causing the leaves to rise with that charge. Both end up with the same type of charge.
Elektrizasyon pa endiksyon (Induction): Without touching, a charged object brought near a conductor causes the conductor’s electrons to rearrange – opposite charges drawn near, like charges repelled far. If the conductor is then grounded (touched momentarily to earth), charges will flow to/from ground. Removing the ground and then the charged object leaves the conductor with a charge opposite to the inducing object. Induction allows charging an object without direct contact and is the principle behind lightning and some electronics (like how a charged cloud induces opposite charge on the ground).
Experiment:
Friction examples: Rub different pairs of materials and use them to pick up bits of paper or attract an electroscope leaf. For example, glass rod and silk, plastic (PVC) pipe and wool, ebonite and fur (if available). Note which combination yields stronger attraction. This can lead to a mini “triboelectric series” discussion.
Conduction demo: Charge a balloon or plastic rod by rubbing. Then touch it to the metal top of the simple electroscope made earlier (or a hanging aluminum can on a string). The electroscope leaves (or the can) will acquire charge and repel apart or move. This shows charge transfer by contact.
Induction demo: Take a metal object (like an aluminum can or foil-wrapped cup) on an insulating stand. Bring a negatively charged balloon near one side – briefly touch the opposite side of the can with your finger (grounding it) while the balloon is near, then remove your finger then the balloon. The can will now be positively charged (and can be tested by repelling from a known positive object, etc.). (Label: Eksperyans: Chaje yon metal pa endiksyon – itilize yon balon chaje ak yon kannèt aliminyòm kòm konduktè.)*
Quiz/Activity:
Scenario question: “Ou fwote yon balon sou cheve w; balon an vin chaje negatif. Kisa k ap pase si w pwoche balon sa a pre yon moso papye ki pa chaje?” (You rub a balloon on your hair; the balloon becomes negatively charged. What happens if you bring this balloon near a neutral piece of paper?) – Expected: The balloon will induce opposite charge on the near side of the paper and attract it, causing the paper to jump toward the balloon . Possibly stick to it. (This is a common observation).
Fill in the blank: “Lè yon baton vè fwote ak swa, baton vè a vin chaje pozitif paske li ______ elektwon.” (When a glass rod is rubbed with silk, the glass becomes positive because it ______ electrons.) – Answer: pèdi (loses electrons).
True/False: “Pa endiksyon, mwen ka chaje yon objè ak yon chaj ki kontran (opoze) ak chaj objè m ap itilize pou endwi a.” (By induction, I can charge an object with the opposite charge of the object I use to induce.) – Answer: True."
Physics,NSII,Chapter 3: Electrostatics (Elektrostatik),"Fenomèn Elektwostatik nan Lavi – Zeklè, Tè ak Aplikasyon (Electrostatic Phenomena – Lightning, Grounding, Applications)","Learning Objectives:
Explain how zeklè (la foudre) lightning occurs as a massive electrostatic discharge between cloud and ground (or between clouds), caused by charge separation in storm clouds.
Discuss the role of a paratonè (lightning rod) – how it protects buildings by providing a conductive path to ground for lightning, illustrating the concept of grounding and preferential discharge.
Identify other applications or effects: static cling in laundry, electrostatic precipitators (pollution control), photocopiers and laser printers using electrostatic charges to attract toner, etc.
Emphasize safety: why we should not shelter under a lone tree in a thunderstorm (tree can act as lightning rod), and why touching live electrical wires with bare hands is dangerous (not exactly static, but relates to charge movement and grounding – bridging concept to current electricity safety).
Key Concepts:
Zeklè (Lightning): In a storm cloud, updrafts and downdrafts cause ice and water droplets to collide and transfer charge (typically the top of cloud becomes positive, bottom negative, though the exact mechanism is complex). The negative bottom induces a positive charge on the ground below by electrostatic induction  . When the electric field becomes intense enough (air breakdown around 3 million V/m), a rapid discharge (spark) occurs – lightning. Lightning is essentially a giant spark that equalizes the charge separation, releasing a huge amount of energy (light, heat, sound as thunder). It follows usually the path of least resistance (often a stepped leader from cloud meets an upward streamer from ground).
Tè (Mise à la terre/Grounding): Connecting a charged object to the earth allows excess charge to dissipate safely because the Earth is a vast reservoir that can supply or accept a practically infinite amount of charge without noticeable change in its potential. We ground electrical systems so that any stray charge or lightning strike goes into Earth rather than causing harm. The lightning rod on buildings is connected to ground; lightning preferentially hits the rod and travels to earth, sparing the building .
Elektrisite estatik nan aplikasyon:
Photocopiers/Printers: They use electrostatic charges on a drum to attract toner particles in the pattern of an image, then transfer to paper and heat-fuse.
Paint spraying: Electrostatic paint sprayers charge paint droplets which are attracted to the oppositely charged object being painted, leading to less waste and even coating.
Air purifiers (precipitators): Charge dust particles in air and use plates of opposite charge to collect them.
Everyday nuisances: clinging clothes (charge buildup), shocks when touching metal after walking on carpet (your body got charged and then discharged), static on comb pulling hair, etc.
Dangers and prevention: Static can ignite flammable vapors (why fueling trucks and airplanes are grounded with a cable before refueling, to discharge static). We should discharge ourselves before touching sensitive electronics (wear a grounding strap) because a tiny electrostatic spark can fry microchips.
Experiment/Demo:
Lightning model: While we can’t create real lightning, a Van de Graaff generator in a lab nicely demonstrates lightning-scale static discharge on a small scale. Using a Van de Graaff, you can show sparks jumping to a grounded sphere or to a person (with appropriate insulation). The crack and light are miniature lightning bolts. If available, have students observe or even experience their hair standing up when touching the charged dome (hair strands repel each other). (Label: Demonstrasyon: Itilize yon dòm Van de Graaff pou kreye mini-zeklè ak fè cheve kanpe.)*
Leyden jar: Create a simple Leyden jar (early capacitor) using a jar, aluminum foil inside and outside. Charge it (e.g., with a Van de Graaff or rubbed rod induction) and then discharge with a metal contact – a spark is seen. This shows how static charge can be stored and suddenly released, analogous to a thundercloud (Leyden jar) discharging as lightning.
Static in everyday objects: Challenge students to pull clothes apart in the dark after they come out of a dryer – sometimes small sparks are visible. Or listen to the crackle. This brings awareness to how static can accumulate. Another fun one: rub a balloon and stick it to the ceiling – see how long it stays (time how slowly the charge leaks off).
Quiz/Activity:
Why question: “Poukisa kout loraj fè plis bri e li pi danjere pase etensèl elektwostatik ou jwenn lè w manyen yon pòt apre w fin mache sou yon tapi?” (Why is a lightning bolt much louder and more dangerous than the little static spark you get when touching a door after walking on carpet?) – Expected answer: Because the amount of charge and energy involved in lightning is enormously greater. Lightning involves billions of joules of energy and a huge current, heating air to plasma (causing thunder), whereas a small static shock has tiny energy (just enough to feel a zap). Essentially scale of charge difference.
Multiple choice: “Pi bon deskripsyon pou kòman yon paratonè pwoteje yon bilding se:” (The best description of how a lightning rod protects a building is:)

 A) It attracts lightning so that it hits the rod instead of the building, and safely conducts the charge to ground.

 B) It prevents lightning by canceling the charges in the cloud.

 C) It stores the lightning’s charge.

 Answer: A) attracts and conducts to ground.
Matching: Match each application to its use of electrostatic principle:
Photocopier – (c. uses electrostatic charges to form image with toner)
Car paint sprayer – (a. charged paint droplets attracted to car surface)
Air purifier – (b. charges dust and collects on plates)
Fuel truck grounding – (d. removes static charge to prevent sparks)

 (Just an example format; correct matching in concept.)"
Physics,NSII,Chapter 3: Electrostatics (Elektrostatik),Lalwa Coulomb ak Fòs Elektwostatik (Coulomb’s Law and Electrostatic Force),"Learning Objectives:
State Coulomb’s Law: the electrostatic force F between two point charges is proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them (F ∝ Q₁·Q₂ / r²). Provide the formula in French: F = k·\frac{Q_1 Q_2}{r^2} with k the Coulomb constant.
Emphasize that the force is attractive if charges are opposite and repulsive if charges are like.
Compare electrostatic force to gravitational force briefly: both are inverse-square laws, but electrostatic can repel or attract (gravity only attracts), and electrostatic forces between small objects can be strong (e.g., a charged comb lifts paper against gravity).
Key Concepts:
De kalite chaj (Two kinds of charge): Menm kalite chaj repouse, kalite opoze atire. (Like charges repel, unlike charges attract.) This is a fundamental rule observed in all electrostatic interactions .
Fòs elektwostatik (Force électrostatique): Acts along the line between two charges. It can be very large for even small charges if they are close (because k ≈ 9×10^9 N·m²/C² is huge). For example, two charges of 1 C each at 1 m distance exert 9×10^9 N of force – an enormous force (but 1 C is an extremely large amount of charge to have on objects). Typically we have microcoulombs or nanocoulombs on charged objects.
Vector nature: The force has direction – repulsive means forces push charges away from each other, attractive means pull together. If multiple charges are present, forces add as vectors (superposition principle) – though that’s advanced, qualitatively one can handle multiple interactions.
We won’t dive too deep into computing with Coulomb’s constant at this level, but students should know the qualitative law and maybe solve a simple proportional reasoning problem (e.g., if distance doubles, force becomes 1/4 as strong).
Experiment:
Quantitative demo (optional): A simple Coulomb’s law demonstration can be done with a torsion balance (like Coulomb’s original apparatus) if available, but that’s rare in school. Alternatively, use two light charged pith balls or balloons on strings: charge them similarly and see them repel. Measure the distance between them for different amounts of charge (more rubbing = more charge = stronger repulsion). It’s qualitative but shows that more charge increases force (balls push further apart) and more distance reduces force (they hang closer when some charge leaks off).
Simulation: Use an electrostatics simulation (like PhET’s “Coulomb’s Law” sim) where students can place two charges, adjust values and distance, and see the force vector and magnitude. This can reinforce the inverse-square relationship in an interactive way.
Quiz/Activity:
Multiple choice: “Si distans ant de chaj double, epi tout lòt bagay rete menm jan, fòs elektwostatik la ap…” (If the distance between two charges doubles, with everything else same, the electrostatic force will…) A) double, B) halve, C) become one-quarter, D) remain same. – Answer: become one-quarter (it follows inverse square).
True/False: “Yon chaj pozitif ka atire yon lòt chaj pozitif si yo ase pre.” (A positive charge can attract another positive charge if they are close enough.) – Answer: False (like charges always repel regardless of distance).
Ask: “Bay de egzanp kote ou santi fòs elektwostatik nan lavi toulejou.” (Give two examples where you feel/observe electrostatic forces in everyday life.) – Expected answers might include: getting a shock after walking on carpet and touching a doorknob (repulsion/attraction causing spark), hair standing on end when combed or near a Van de Graaff generator (each hair becomes similarly charged and repels others), clinging clothes from the dryer (opposite charges attracting), etc. Each example can lead to identifying the charges and forces involved."
Physics,NSII,Chapter 4: Magnetism (Manyetis),Chan Mayetik ak Liy Fòs (Magnetic Field and Field Lines),"Learning Objectives:
Describe a chan mayetik (champ magnétique) as the region around a magnet where magnetic forces can be felt. It is invisible but can be visualized with field lines.
Draw or recognize the pattern of liy fòs mayetik (magnetic field lines) around a bar magnet: lines emanate from the North pole, curve through space, and enter the South pole . Inside the magnet, lines go from S back to N (making closed loops).
Understand that the density of field lines indicates the strength of the field (closer near poles). Field lines never intersect. A compass aligns along field lines – its north end points in the direction of the local magnetic field (toward a nearby magnet’s south pole or toward Earth’s magnetic south in the north direction).
Key Concepts:
Chan mayetik: A vector field in space produced by magnets or moving charges (current). At each point, it has a direction and magnitude. The direction is defined as the direction a compass north pole would point if placed there.
Liy chan (field lines): A visual tool: we draw lines that show how a small test north pole would move. They start on North poles and end on South poles externally . The lines are denser (closer together) near the poles, showing a stronger field. Farther away, they spread out (weaker field). The fact they form loops reflects that there are no isolated poles (unlike electric field lines which can start or end on charges).
Filings demonstration explanation: Iron filings sprinkled around a magnet align along field lines because each tiny filing becomes a tiny magnet by induction and lines up North-to-South along the field  . Thus, we see the curved patterns (like in the embedded image). This is a direct visualization of something normally abstract.
Earth’s magnetic field: Earth itself has a magnetic field similar to a giant bar magnet tilted a bit from the rotation axis. It protects us from solar wind and causes compass needles to point north (toward the Arctic, which is actually a magnetic south pole). Field lines emerge near Antarctica (geo south, magnetic N) and enter near Arctic (geo north, magnetic S) – hence compass north pole points geographic north (attracted to Earth’s magnetic south there).
(Advanced mention: units of B-field are Tesla (T) or Gauss; but at this level just conceptual.)
Experiment:
Iron filings visualization: Place a bar magnet under a clear plastic sheet or a glass plate. Gently sprinkle iron filings on top and tap the surface lightly. The filings will align and reveal the field line pattern emerging from one pole and curving into the other. Draw what is observed. Alternatively, use small compasses placed around the magnet to show direction at various points (each compass tangent to a field line). (Label: Eksperyans: Sèvi ak limadura fè (iron filings) pou montre liy chan mayetik alantou yon mayet .)*
Compass mapping: Move a compass around a magnet, marking the direction it points at various locations on paper. Connect the arrows to sketch the field lines. Ensure to indicate arrow direction (N→S outside magnet). Do this on both sides of the magnet to get the full loop picture.
Earth field demonstration: Suspend a bar magnet on a string (or use a compass) to verify it aligns roughly north-south. Discuss how that means Earth has a field. If available, show a 3D depiction of Earth’s field or use a globe with a bar magnet through it to illustrate.
Quiz/Activity:
Draw field lines: Give a diagram of a bar magnet, ask students to draw a few representative field lines from the north to south pole. Emphasize arrowheads and that lines go out of N, into S.
True/False: “Liy fòs mayetik yo janm koupe youn lòt.” (Magnetic field lines never cross one another.) – Answer: True (field at a point has a unique direction; crossing lines would imply two directions at one point, impossible).
Multiple choice: “Yon konpa mete toupre yon mayet prensipal pral montre…” (A compass placed near a bar magnet will show…) A) direction of magnet’s field at that point, B) always point north geographic, regardless of magnet, C) the strength of the field but not direction. – Correct: A) direction of field at that point.
Fill in: “Chan mayetik la pi fò kote liy mayetik yo ______ (pi pre / pi lwen) youn ak lòt.” (The magnetic field is strongest where the field lines are ______ (closer / farther) to each other.) – Expected: pi pre (closer)."
Physics,NSII,Chapter 4: Magnetism (Manyetis),Elektwomayetis – Fè yon Elektwomayet ak Aplikasyon (Electromagnetism – Making an Electromagnet and Applications),"Learning Objectives:
Demonstrate that an electric current creates a magnetic field (Oersted’s discovery: current in a wire deflects a compass needle).
Build a simple elektwomayet (électroaimant) by winding insulated wire around an iron nail and connecting to a battery – it acts like a magnet when current flows.
Understand that electromagnets can be turned on/off and are used in many devices (motors, speakers, cranes to lift scrap metal, etc.).
Recognize the interplay of electricity and magnetism: changing magnetic fields can induce currents (to be fully covered later, but mention generators). This is a sneak peek that sets stage for future studies.
Key Concepts:
Kouran pwodui mayetis: In 1820, Oersted found that a compass needle moved when near a current-carrying wire . This showed electricity can create magnetism. The magnetic field around a straight wire forms concentric circles around the wire (direction given by right-hand rule if advanced: thumb = current, fingers curl in direction of field).
Elektwomayet: Wrapping a wire into a coil (solenoid) amplifies the magnetic field because each loop’s field adds up. Inserting a soft iron core (like a nail) concentrates the field greatly (the iron becomes a temporary magnet), making a strong electromagnet. When current flows, the nail behaves like a magnet (with a north and south pole); when current stops, the nail loses most magnetism (if it’s soft iron). This is useful: you can turn magnetism on/off with a switch.
Fòs elektwomayet: It depends on number of coil turns, the current, and the core material. More turns or more current -> stronger magnet. However, too high current can heat the wire (Joule heating) – caution.
Aplikasyon:
Electric bell or buzzer: electromagnet pulls a striker to ring a bell, then circuit breaks, it releases, repeats (rapid on/off).
Relays: electromagnets that open/close switches in circuits.
Cranes in junkyards: lift heavy scrap iron by energizing a giant electromagnet, then drop by cutting power.
Speakers: use electromagnets (voice coil) interacting with a permanent magnet to vibrate and produce sound.
Motors and Generators: In motors, electromagnets on a rotor interact with field magnets to produce rotation. In generators, moving magnets induce current in coils (the flip side of electromagnetism – Faraday’s law).
Maxwell’s unification: (For enrichment) Electricity and magnetism are aspects of one electromagnetic force – changing electric fields create magnetic fields and vice versa (though we won’t explore full math). This led to radio, etc., as changing currents can create electromagnetic waves.
Experiment:
Oersted’s experiment: Lay a straight insulated wire over a compass. Connect the wire to a battery (through a switch). When current flows, the compass needle deflects perpendicular to the wire. Reverse the battery connection (current direction) – the needle deflects the opposite way. This shows current produces a magnetic field with direction relative to current. (Label: Eksperyans: Montre efè Oersted – kouran nan yon fil fè zegwi konpa deplase.)*
Make an electromagnet: Take a large iron nail, wrap about 30 turns of insulated copper wire around it. Connect to, say, a 6 V battery. Use the nail to pick up paperclips or small iron filings. It should behave as a magnet when current flows. Disconnect one battery terminal – paperclips drop (magnet off). Optionally, count how many paperclips it can hold for different coils or current (more batteries or turns yields more). Ensure not to short or overheat the battery – use reasonable current (a resistor or a low-voltage high-current supply could be used).
Demonstrate a relay (if available): Show a small relay or bell which uses an electromagnet to move something when energized. Or use the built electromagnet to attract a small hinged strip of iron (making a click) as a basic telegraph sounder.
Quiz/Activity:
True/False: “Yon mayet ka pwodwi elektrisite, epi kouran elektrik ka pwodwi mayetis.” (A magnet can produce electricity, and an electric current can produce magnetism.) – Answer: True. (This is a fundamental principle – though how magnet produces electricity is by moving it relative to a coil – faraday’s law, might mention briefly.)
Fill in: “Pou m fè yon elektwomayet pi fò, mwen ka ______ kantite espir nan bobin nan oswa ______ entansite kouran an.” (To make an electromagnet stronger, I can ______ the number of turns in the coil or ______ the current.) – Expected: ogmante (increase) for both blanks.
Question: “Ki avantaj yon elektwomayet genyen sou yon mayet pèmanan?” (What is an advantage of an electromagnet over a permanent magnet?) – Possible answers: It can be turned on and off; its strength can be changed by adjusting current; it can be made stronger than some permanent magnets; can be shaped and placed conveniently (e.g., in motors) and controlled remotely.
Application match: Match the device with how it uses electromagnets:

 A) Loudspeaker – (uses a coil that moves in a magnetic field to vibrate a cone for sound),

 B) Crane for scrap metal – (uses a powerful electromagnet to pick up and drop metal),

 C) Electric motor – (uses electromagnets that continuously change polarity to rotate a shaft),

 D) Doorbell – (uses an electromagnet to pull a striker to hit the bell when you press the button)."
Physics,NSII,Chapter 4: Magnetism (Manyetis),Latè kòm yon Gwo Mayet – Konpa ak Deklinasyon (Earth as a Giant Magnet – Compass and Declination),"Learning Objectives:
Explain that Earth has a magnetic field similar to that of a bar magnet tilted relative to the rotation axis.
Describe how a konpa (compass) works: the magnetized needle aligns with Earth’s magnetic field, thus pointing (approximately) north-south.
Introduce the concept of deklinasyon mayetik (magnetic declination): the angle between geographic north and magnetic north at a given location, which can vary (so compasses point to magnetic north, not true north).
Mention how Earth’s magnetic poles wander and even occasionally flip over geological time (briefly, for curiosity).
Key Concepts:
Latè gen mayetis: Caused by electric currents in the molten outer core (dynamo effect). The Earth’s magnetic field is roughly like a bar magnet inclined ~11° from the rotational axis. The south magnetic pole is near the geographic North Pole (currently in Northern Canada area), and the north magnetic pole is near geographic South Pole in Antarctica .
Konpa: A small lightweight magnet free to rotate. The marked “N” end of the needle is actually a magnetic north pole of the needle, which is attracted to Earth’s magnetic south (which lies toward the geographic north). So the compass “north” arrow points geographic north (with some offset if declination is present). This has been used for navigation for centuries.
Deklinasyon: In Haiti, for instance, the magnetic declination might be a few degrees (need to check, likely slight west). We explain that a compass doesn’t necessarily point exactly to the true north (pole). For practical field navigation at this level, students just note it’s approximate. But in more precise contexts, maps give local declination to correct compass readings.
Enpòtans pratik: Navigation with a compass (especially before GPS) requires understanding declination. Also mention that some animals (birds, sea turtles, etc.) navigate using Earth’s magnetic field (magnetoreception).
Chanjman mayetik latè: The magnetic poles drift year by year. Occasionally (every few hundred thousand years), Earth’s field flips (north and south poles swap). We know this from rock records (paleomagnetism). Not directly necessary, but it’s an interesting fact to show magnetism is dynamic.
Proteksyon latè: Earth’s magnetic field extends into space as the magnetosfè (magnetosphere), shielding us from solar wind. The interactions cause auroras (northern/southern lights) near the poles, where charged solar particles spiral in along field lines and hit the atmosphere  .
Experiment:
Using a compass: Take students outside with compasses, have them locate north as per the compass. Compare with a map or known directions (e.g., where the sun sets/rises) to gauge how accurate it is. Possibly note any small offset if known.
Magnet and globe: Stick a bar magnet through a Styrofoam ball or globe (tilted relative to “axis”). Use a compass around the globe’s surface to mimic how Earth’s field would make it point. Show that at the equator compass points horizontally, closer to poles it might dip (compass needles are often weighted to counter “dip” of field lines at higher latitudes). This shows Earth’s field 3D nature.
Aurora visualization (optional): Show a picture or video of auroras and explain how they occur along field lines near poles (charged particles guided by Earth’s magnetism colliding with air to emit light). This connects magnetism to real phenomena. (If in class, teacher demonstration with a magnet and cathode ray tube or plasma globe can mimic this, but likely not accessible.)
Quiz/Activity:
Q: “Kouman yon konpa travay pou montre direksyon nò a?” (How does a compass work to show the north direction?) – Answer: It’s a small magnet that aligns with Earth’s magnetic field; its north-pointing end is attracted toward Earth’s magnetic south pole near the geographic North, thus it indicates north.
True/False: “Pòl mayetik Latè yo koresponn egzakteman ak Pòl Jewografik yo.” (Earth’s magnetic poles align exactly with its geographic poles.) – Answer: False (there is a tilt/offset; also they wander over time).
Fill in: “Si w nan peyi dòtou Ekwatè, zegwi konpa a ap [kouche plat / panche] yon ti jan.” (If you are near the Earth’s equator, a compass needle will be [flat / tilted] somewhat.) – Expected: kouche plat (nearly horizontal). (If near poles, it would tilt vertically, but most compasses are designed to stay mostly horizontal in their intended hemisphere).
Ask: “Ki avantaj chan mayetik Latè a bay planèt nou an?” (What advantage does Earth’s magnetic field provide our planet?) – Expected: It protects us from charged solar particles (radiation), preventing them from stripping the atmosphere and causing damage to living things; it also enables navigation by compass. Possibly mention auroras as a side effect of this protective field."
Physics,NSII,Chapter 4: Magnetism (Manyetis),Pwopriyete Mayet – Pòl Nò ak Pòl Sid (Magnet Properties – North and South Poles),"Learning Objectives:
Identify the two poles of a magnet (pòl nò and pòl sid) and understand that they always come in pairs. If a magnet is cut, you get smaller magnets each with N and S poles.
State the law of magnetic poles: like poles repel, unlike poles attract (e.g., N–N repel, N–S attract) .
Recognize magnetic materials (iron, nickel, cobalt, and some alloys like steel) versus non-magnetic materials. Understand that only certain materials can be magnetized or strongly attracted by magnets (ferromagnetic).
Key Concepts:
Manyet natirèl ak atifisyèl: Natural magnets (like lodestone, an iron ore) were known historically. Modern magnets (bar magnets, fridge magnets, etc.) are typically made of ferromagnetic materials that have been magnetized (domains aligned).
Pòl manyetik: By convention, a magnet’s north pole is the end that points toward Earth’s geographic north when allowed to rotate freely (like in a compass). Actually, Earth’s geographic north corresponds to a magnetic south polarity (since opposite poles attract, Earth’s North Pole region is magnetically a south pole attracting the north end of magnets) .
Entèraksyon poto manyetik: Bring two bar magnets close: N to N will push away (repulsion), N to S will pull together (attraction), like charges in electrostatics. This is a non-contact force acting through space via the magnetic field.
Materyo feromayetik: Iron (Fe) is strongly attracted to magnets and can become a temporary magnet when near one (induced magnetism). Steel contains iron and can be magnetized (permanently if stroked by a magnet). Materials like plastic, wood, copper are not attracted (non-magnetic). Only ferromagnetic materials can be picked up by a magnet.
Magnetic induction: When you place a piece of iron near a magnet, it actually becomes a magnet on its own (temporary) with opposite pole facing the original magnet’s pole – that’s why it sticks. Remove the magnet, pure iron loses magnetism (soft iron), but steel can retain (hard magnetic material).
Experiment:
Pole identification with compass: Take a bar magnet and a compass. The compass needle’s north-pointing end will be attracted to the magnet’s south pole and repelled by its north pole. Label the magnet’s poles accordingly. Alternatively, suspend a bar magnet by a string; once it settles, one end points (approx) north – that end is the north pole of the magnet. (Label: Eksperyans: Idantifye pòl N ak S yon mayet ak konpa.)*
Like vs unlike poles: Using two bar magnets, try different end combinations and feel/observe the forces. Have students physically experience the push or pull. If using strong magnets, caution about sudden snaps.
Test materials: Provide various small objects (nail, coin, aluminum foil, plastic pen, etc.) and a magnet. Let students predict and then test which are attracted. Explain why (coins: depends on composition – e.g., US pennies are not magnetic, some other country coins might be steel and are magnetic, etc.). Emphasize iron/steel objects (paperclip, nail) stick, others (wood, plastic, copper wire) do not.
Quiz/Activity:
True/False: “Si mwen fann yon mayet an de, m ap jwenn yon pati ki gen sèlman yon pòl nò e yon lòt pati ki gen sèlman yon pòl sid.” (If I cut a magnet in half, I will get one piece that has only a north pole and another piece that has only a south pole.) – Answer: False (each piece will have both a north and south pole).
Fill in the blank: “Lè youn pòm manyetik (pòl) mayet la pwoche toupre menm kalite pòm sou yon lòt mayet, yo pral ______. Lè l pwoche kont pòm opoze a, yo pral ______.” (When one magnetic pole is brought near the same kind of pole of another magnet, they will ______. Brought near the opposite pole, they will ______.) – Expected: repouse (repel); atire (attract).
List question: “Site de metal ki atire pa mayet, ak de lòt materyèl ki pa reyaji ak yon mayet.” (Name two metals attracted by a magnet, and two materials that do not react to a magnet.) – Possible answers: attracted – iron, steel, nickel, cobalt; not attracted – plastic, wood, copper, aluminum, etc. (Many students think all metals are magnetic; clarify aluminum, copper, gold, etc. are not ferromagnetic.)"
Physics,NSII,Chapter 5: Energy and Transformations (Enèji ak Transfòmasyon li),Enèji Mekanik – Enèji Sinetik ak Potansyèl (Mechanical Energy – Kinetic and Potential Energy),"Learning Objectives:
Define enèji sinetik (énergie cinétique) as the energy of motion. Formula: E_k = ½ m v². Understand that faster and heavier objects have more kinetic energy.
Define enèji potansyèl gravitasiyonèl (énergie potentielle gravitationnelle) as energy stored due to an object’s height in a gravitational field. Formula: E_p = m g h. Higher and heavier objects have more potential energy (relative to a reference level).
Understand konsèvasyon enèji mekanik (conservation of mechanical energy) in absence of friction: E_k + E_p = constant. Energy can transform from potential to kinetic and vice versa, but total remains the same  . For example, a falling object converts potential into kinetic, a swinging pendulum trades height and speed.
Work-Energy: Doing work on an object increases its kinetic or potential energy. Conversely, the work done by gravity when something falls equals the loss of potential and gain of kinetic.
Key Concepts:
Enèji sinetik (Kinetic energy, K.E.): Energy of motion. Any moving mass has K.E. If mass m and speed v, E_k = ½ m v². It’s scalar, measured in joules. Doubling mass doubles K.E., doubling speed quadruples K.E. (so speed contributes heavily – a car at 60 km/h has 4× the kinetic energy as at 30 km/h).
Enèji potansyèl gravitasyon (Gravitational P.E.): Energy stored due to height. E_p = m g h relative to some reference (often ground = 0). Lifting an object increases its E_p. If it falls, that energy can convert to kinetic (and then maybe to heat/sound upon impact).
Konvèsyon E_p ↔ E_k: For example, drop a rock from height h: it starts with E_p = mgh, K.E.=0 (if starting from rest). Just before hitting ground, ideally all that E_p becomes K.E., so ½ m v² = m g h. Solving yields v = sqrt(2gh) – which is the speed from free-fall distance h (ignoring air). If throw up an object, kinetic converts to potential until at top K.E.=0, all converted to potential. Then it falls back converting back to kinetic.
Konseve mekanik: In absence of dissipative forces (no friction/air resistance), total mechanical energy (E_k + E_p) stays constant. Example: pendulum – at highest point, all E_p (max height, zero speed); at lowest point, all E_k (fastest, min height), intermediate positions mix the two. In reality, friction/air slowly remove some energy (damping), turning it to heat, so amplitude dies down – mechanical energy isn’t strictly conserved then because it’s lost to thermal, but total energy (including thermal) is still conserved universally.
Possibly mention Spring potential energy if spring studied: E_p(spring) = ½ k x² (like in NS I or NS III?), but if not covered, skip.
The Law of Energy Conservation (first law of thermodynamics): Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another or transferred between objects. The mechanical energy conservation is a subset (neglecting other forms). In all processes, total energy (mechanical + heat + others) remains constant .
Experiment:
Ball drop and rebound: Drop a ball from a known height and measure rebound height. It doesn’t come back to original height – why? Because some mechanical energy lost to heat, sound, deformation (not fully elastic). Measure initial E_p = mgh, and after bounce E_p = mg h_rebound. The difference is energy “lost” (converted to other forms). This shows energy conservation including non-mechanical forms.
Pendulum: Use a simple pendulum (a weight on a string). Measure its speed at bottom if possible (perhaps using a photogate) and height difference from release to bottom. Show mgh lost = ½ m v² gained (approximately). Alternatively, use a swinging bowling ball or similar in front of class to demonstrate trust in energy conservation: hold it at nose and release (don’t push) – it will swing out and come back but not quite reach original height (so it won’t hit your face if you don’t move). This demonstrates conversion between potential and kinetic safely (assuming no push given!). (Safety: done carefully). Label: Demonstrasyon: Pendil boul la konvèti enèji ant potansyèl ak sinetik; li pap depase pwen lage a si pa gen enèji ajoute.)*
Cart on ramp: Roll a cart down a frictionless track from height h and measure its speed at bottom using a motion sensor or photogate. Check if ½ m v² ≈ m g h (should match closely if low friction).
Quiz/Activity:
Fill in blanks: “Fòmil enèji sinetik la se E_k = \tfrac{1}{2} m v^2. Sa vle di si vitès yon objè double, enèji sinetik li ap ______.” – Answer: ogmante pa yon faktè 4 (quadruple).
Calculation: “Yon ti wòch 0.5 kg lage soti 10 m wotè. Konbyen enèji potansyèl li pèdi lè li rive atè a? Si nou neglije rezistans lè, ki enèji sinetik li genyen jis anvan li frape atè a, epi konbyen vitès li?” – Solution: E_p lost = mgh = 0.59.810 ≈ 49 J. That becomes K.E. = ~49 J. ½ m v² = 49, so v² = 49*2/0.5 = 196, v ≈ 14 m/s.
Conceptual: “Yon machin ak yon moto ap kouri ak menm vitès. Kilès ki gen plis enèji sinetik? Poukisa?” – Answer: The car, because it has much more mass. (Even at same speed, greater m gives greater K.E.)
True/False: “Enèji mekanik total yon sistèm toujou konsève menm lè gen fwiksyon.” – Answer: False (mechanical energy will decrease due to friction converting some into heat; only total energy including heat is conserved).
Challenge: “Dekri chèn transfòmasyon enèji ki fèt lè yon moun so (sote) soti yon tab: ki kalite enèji li genyen sou tab la, pandan li tonbe, epi lè li touche tè a? Kisa enèji final sa a vin tounen?” – Expected reasoning: On table: mostly potential energy (mgh). During fall: potential converts into kinetic (increasing speed). On hitting ground: kinetic energy is dispersed as sound, thermal energy, and some energy goes into deforming ground or body slightly; ultimately the mechanical energy turns into heat in the environment and body (and sound waves). This shows energy conservation with different forms."
Physics,NSII,Chapter 5: Energy and Transformations (Enèji ak Transfòmasyon li),Sous Enèji ak Itilizasyon Dirab (Energy Sources and Sustainable Use),"Learning Objectives:
Identify various sous enèji (sources of energy) we use: fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas), renewable sources (solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, biomass), and nuclear.
Understand that these sources are used to generate electricity or directly for transport/heating, and each has pros/cons (e.g., fossil fuels high energy content but cause pollution and are non-renewable; renewables are cleaner but can be intermittent, etc.).
Emphasize the concept of renewable vs non-renewable: renewable sources are replenished naturally on human timescales (sun, wind, water, biomass), while non-renewable (fossil fuels, uranium) are finite.
Encourage awareness of sustainable energy use: the need to conserve resources and use cleaner energy to reduce environmental impact (like greenhouse effect causing climate change).
Mention efficiency again in context: using efficient technology and reducing waste helps make our energy supply more sustainable.
Key Concepts:
Sous fosil (Fossil fuels): Coal, oil, natural gas – formed from ancient organic matter over millions of years. High energy density, currently dominant, but release CO₂ (a greenhouse gas) when burned , contributing to global warming, and pollutants (SOx, NOx, particulates). Also finite reserves.
Enèji tèmik (Thermal energy) to electric: In power plants, usually burn fuel to boil water -> steam turns turbine -> generator converts to electricity. Efficiency limited (~35-40% for coal plants, ~60% for combined cycle gas). The rest of energy is waste heat. Nuclear plants similarly heat water (via nuclear fission) to steam.
Renewable sources:
Solè (Solar): Sunlight converted to electricity via photovoltaic panels, or to heat via solar thermal. Clean and infinite but intermittent (daytime only, weather dependent).
Van (Wind): Airflow turns turbines to generate electricity. Clean, renewable, but variable and needs suitable locations.
Dlo (Hydro): Water stored in dams (potential energy) -> kinetic through turbines -> electricity. Very efficient and steady, but requires large rivers and can have ecological impacts.
Jeotèmik (Geothermal): Using Earth’s internal heat (in volcanic areas or deep heat) for power or heating. Reliable in certain regions.
Biomass: Burning wood or biofuels (ethanol, biodiesel) – renewable if replanted, but still emits CO₂ (though reabsorbed by new growth ideally).
Mare/wave (tidal, wave): Tides (from Moon’s gravity) and wave motion can generate electricity; still experimental in many places.
Nukleyè (Nuclear): Uses uranium fission. Very high energy density, no CO₂ during operation, but produces radioactive waste and has safety concerns (radiation risk, potential accidents, issues of waste storage for millennia). Also not renewable (uranium is finite, though quite abundant).
Chanjman klimatik (Climate change): Burning fossil fuels has increased atmospheric CO₂, causing the greenhouse effect to strengthen  – leading to global warming and climate changes (melting ice, extreme weather, sea-level rise). Thus, shift to low-carbon energy sources is needed.
Dirabilite (Sustainability): Meeting our energy needs without compromising future generations. This means using more renewables, improving efficiency, and conserving energy where possible. For example, LED bulbs, fuel-efficient or electric vehicles, better insulation in buildings, etc.
Haiti context (if relevant): Possibly discuss what energy sources are common in Haiti (e.g., charcoal/wood for cooking – biomass, which causes deforestation and indoor pollution; some hydro power for electricity; imported petroleum fuels). Encourage thinking about solar potential in Haiti, etc., and challenges like infrastructure, cost.
Experiment/Activity:
Not many hands-on in classroom aside from small solar panel demos or windmill kits if available. If a small solar cell and motor or light can be used, show sunlight (or bright lamp) making a motor spin or LED light. Or a hand-crank generator to light a bulb (mechanical-> electrical). This can illustrate energy conversion and effort needed.
Possibly analyze home electricity bill or appliance wattages: get students to list high wattage appliances (AC, fridge, iron) vs low (LED lamp, phone charger) and consider usage patterns to see where most energy is consumed and could be saved.
Debate or presentation: split class into groups each presenting one energy source with its pros and cons (fossil vs solar vs wind vs etc.), then discuss which mix is ideal.
Quiz/Activity:
Matching: Match each energy source with its description or advantage: e.g., Solar – (c) abundant and clean but intermittent; Coal – (a) widely available but polluting; Wind – (d) clean but variable; Nuclear – (b) high output, no CO₂ but radioactive waste, etc.
True/False: “Enèji van ak enèji solè pa janm ka ranplase totalman gaz fosil paske yo entèmitan.” (Wind and solar energy can never replace fossil fuels entirely because they are intermittent.) – Answer: False (with energy storage and grid management, they potentially could supply most or all power; also other renewables/nuclear can complement – this is a nuanced question to spur thought that intermittent is a challenge but not an impossible barrier).
Short answer: “Ki pwoblèm ki asosye ak depandans sou chabon, petwòl ak gaz nan pwodiksyon enèji?” (What problems are associated with reliance on coal, oil, and gas for energy production?) – Expected: They are non-renewable (will run out eventually), cause pollution (air pollution, smog), and emit greenhouse gases leading to climate change  . Also geopolitical issues (oil price spikes, etc.) might be mentioned.
Discussion: “Kijan ou panse nou ka ogmante itilizasyon enèji renouvlab nan kominote nou an?” (How do you think we can increase the use of renewable energy in our community?) – Students might suggest: installing solar panels on homes or schools, wind turbines if feasible, using more hydro if rivers available, government incentives, education on energy saving. Encourage creative thinking about practical steps.
Conclusion: By learning about energy in its various forms – mechanical, thermal, electrical, chemical – and the ways it can be converted and conserved, students gain a holistic understanding of how the physical world and technology operate. Mastery of these concepts prepares them to make informed decisions about energy use and to appreciate the importance of efficient and sustainable energy solutions for the future ."
Physics,NSII,Chapter 5: Energy and Transformations (Enèji ak Transfòmasyon li),Transfòmasyon Enèji ak Konsèvasyon (Energy Transformation and Conservation),"Learning Objectives:
Reinforce the principle of konsèvasyon enèji: energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another or transferred between objects .
Give examples of energy transformations in everyday processes: e.g., chemical energy in gasoline -> kinetic + heat in car, solar energy -> chemical in plants (photosynthesis), electrical -> light + heat in a bulb, etc.
Introduce the concept of rendman (efficiency): not all input energy in a system appears as useful output; some is lost as waste heat or other forms. Efficiency = (useful energy out / total energy in) × 100%.
Emphasize the importance of energy conservation in technology and environmental context – using efficient devices and converting energy with minimal losses (like LED bulbs vs incandescent).
Key Concepts:
Lwa konsèvasyon enèji jeneral: The total energy of an isolated system remains constant. This is a fundamental law of physics. Energy can change forms (mechanical, thermal, chemical, nuclear, electrical, radiant, etc.) but the sum remains the same. This is sometimes phrased: “Enèji pa janm pèdi; li toujou parèt yon kote.” (Energy is never lost; it always shows up somewhere.) If something “uses up” energy, that energy has been converted to another form (often unwanted heat).
Transfòmasyon enèji (Energy transformations):
A battery: chemical energy -> electrical energy (in circuit) -> which can further become light (in a lamp) + heat.
A car: chemical energy in fuel -> kinetic energy (motion) + heat in engine & exhaust + sound.
A hydroelectric dam: potential energy of water -> kinetic of water -> mechanical (turbine) -> electrical energy (generator).
Human body: chemical energy in food -> mechanical work (muscles) + body heat.
Photosynthesis: light (solar) -> chemical energy in glucose. Combustion: chemical -> heat + light.
Almost any process will have multiple forms in chain: trace them in common appliances.
Randman (Efficiency): Defined as η = (useful output energy or power) / (input energy or power). Often expressed in percentage. No process is 100% efficient if there are losses. For instance, an incandescent bulb maybe 5% efficient (5% light, 95% heat), whereas LED might be 40% efficient (much more light for same energy). Heat engines (like car engines) have efficiencies typically 20-30%.
Because of losses (often thermal), designing systems to reduce loss improves efficiency. E.g., insulating a house saves thermal energy, using energy-saving appliances wastes less.
Dezyèm lwa tèmoydinamik (Second law of thermodynamics) might be alluded to in simple terms: in any energy conversion, some energy tends to disperse as heat (increase in entropy), meaning you cannot convert all energy to useful work with 100% efficiency. Heat tends to spread out and become less usable. This is why perpetual motion machines are impossible – you always lose some energy to heat. But this may be too advanced; just assert that some waste heat is inevitable in conversions.
Environment angle: Burning fuel -> heat & CO₂ (waste); wasted energy often ends up as low-grade heat in the environment. Energy conservation in usage (less waste) means less fuel burnt and less environmental impact.
Experiment:
Efficiency of a light bulb: Compare an incandescent vs LED (or CFL) bulb of similar light output. Feel which gets hotter (incandescent gets very hot -> lots of energy to heat, LED stays cool -> more to light). If possible, measure power draw (with a wattmeter). Discuss lumens per watt. Not a precise calc without proper tools, but qualitatively LED is more efficient.
Human work vs heat: Have a student rapidly do step-ups or jumping jacks for 1 minute. They convert chemical energy to mechanical, but most mechanical work ends up as internal heat (they feel hot, sweaty) plus some dissipated in floor as sound/vibration. Use a thermometer to measure a slight rise in their body skin temperature or just note flushed face. Illustrates that much of the energy they “burn” goes to heat, not just the motion (which stops, leaving only heat).
Heat engine model: If available, a simple steam engine or Stirling engine demo can show mechanical work from heat and how hot/cold reservoirs are involved, but if not, perhaps skip. Or show a bouncing ball losing energy each bounce (turning mechanical energy into sound/heat in each impact) – energy isn’t destroyed, just moved to less obvious forms.
Quiz/Activity:
Provide scenarios and ask to identify energy transformations: e.g., “Nan yon éolienne (turbin van), ki chèn transfòmasyon enèji ki rive?” (In a wind turbine, what is the chain of energy transformations?) – Expected: kinetic energy of wind -> mechanical rotation energy -> electrical energy (plus some losses to heat and sound).
Multiple choice: “Ki deklarasyon ki pi kòrèk sou konsèvasyon enèji?” A) Energy can be created by nuclear reactors. B) Energy is lost when machines aren’t efficient. C) The total energy in a closed system remains constant . D) If we conserve energy (use less), the law of conservation is violated. – Correct: C. (We clarify A: reactors convert mass to energy but if including mass-energy total, still conserved; B: energy isn’t lost, just wasted as unwanted forms; D: using less energy just means less conversion from one form to another).
Calculation example: “Yon motè machin bay 30 kJ nan enèji mekanik pandan li boule 100 kJ gazolin. Ki randman li?” (A car engine delivers 30 kJ of mechanical energy while burning 100 kJ of gasoline. What is its efficiency?) – Answer: 30/100 = 0.3 -> 30% efficiency. (The 70 kJ likely went to heat in engine, exhaust, etc.)
True/False: “Yon anpoul ki byen cho vle di li trè efikas nan konvèti enèji an limyè.” (A bulb that is very hot means it is very efficient at converting energy to light.) – Answer: False (heat is wasted energy in this context; a cooler bulb for same light output is more efficient).
Discussion: “Bay yon egzanp kijan nou ka amelyore efikasite nan itilizasyon enèji lakay nou.” (Give an example of how we can improve efficiency in energy use at home.) – Expected answers: using LED bulbs instead of incandescent, insulating the house to reduce heat loss, using energy star appliances, not wasting by leaving devices on, etc. This links physics to practical life."
Physics,NSII,Chapter 5: Energy and Transformations (Enèji ak Transfòmasyon li),Travay Fòs – Definisyon ak Egzanp (Work Done by a Force: Definition and Examples),"Learning Objectives:
Define travay (work) in the physics sense: work is done when a force causes displacement in the direction of the force. Formula: W = F · d · cosθ.
Understand the SI unit of work/energy is the joule (J). 1 J = work done by 1 N force moving an object 1 m in the direction of force.
Identify situations where a force does work versus no work (e.g., carrying an object horizontally – no work done against gravity if height doesn’t change, despite effort felt) .
Apply the concept: calculate simple work examples (lifting an object, pulling a box, etc.) and relate work to energy transfer.
Key Concepts:
Definisyon travay (travay): Travay fèt lè yon fòs deplase yon kò nan direksyon konpozan fòs la. (Work is done when a force moves a body in the direction of the force’s component.) If you push/pull something and it moves, you do work on it. If you apply a force and it doesn’t move (like pushing a wall), you do no work (in physics terms) despite feeling tired – because displacement is zero, W=0.
Fòmil: W = F × d × cosθ, where θ is angle between force direction and displacement direction. If force is in exactly same direction as motion, W = F×d. If perpendicular (θ=90°), W = 0 (e.g., carrying a suitcase horizontally – weight force is vertical, displacement horizontal). This explains scenarios like a person holding weight stationary does no work on the weight (though their muscles expend energy internally).
Egzanp: Lifting a 5 kg object by 2 m: Force = mg ~ 5×9.8 = 49 N upward, displacement 2 m upward, work = 49N×2m = ~98 J done by you (and +98 J potential energy gained by object). Pulling a cart 10 m with 20 N force: 200 J work. If you push at an angle, only the component along motion does work.
Travay pozitif/negatif: If force helps motion, it does positive work (adds energy to object). If force opposes motion (like friction or you lowering an object gently), it does negative work (removes energy from object, perhaps adding to thermal or your muscle energy). But probably just mention: work can be negative if force and displacement are opposite (object loses energy to that force).
Work-Energy Principle: Doing work on an object transfers energy to it. Work done = change in energy of object (if no losses). For example, lifting increases gravitational potential energy, pushing a car increases its kinetic energy.
Experiment:
Lifting work measurement: Using a spring scale (dynamometer) and weights: measure the force to lift a weight slowly (it should read roughly mg). Multiply by height lifted. Compare that to the increase in potential energy (mgh). If you have a motion sensor or just by time and known distance, confirm roughly that energy gained equals work input (neglecting minor losses). This is more demonstration than precise lab.
Ramp and work: Pull a cart up a ramp vs lifting vertically. Use a force sensor or spring scale to pull the cart slowly up a gentle incline a longer distance vs lifting straight up a shorter distance. Show that Force is less on ramp but distance is more; F×d is about the same as mgh (work against gravity) ignoring friction. This illustrates work is path-independent in gravity (conservative force) – work done either way ~ equal to gain in potential energy. (Label: Eksperyans: Konpare travay pou monte yon objè dwat monte vs sou yon plan enkline.)*
No work scenario: Have a student hold a heavy textbook at fixed height for a minute. They feel tired (chemical energy spent in muscles) but from physics view, no work done on book since no displacement. Discuss why they still tire – internal work in body, inefficiency.
Quiz/Activity:
True/False: “Si yon moun pouse yon machin ak tout fòs li men machin nan pa deplase, li fè anpil travay sou machin nan.” (If someone pushes a car with all their might but it doesn’t move, they do a lot of work on the car.) – Answer: False (no displacement, so zero work on the car; energy is wasted in his body or friction).
Calculation: “Yon bwat 10 kg sou planche a, rale l pou 3 m ak yon fòs 50 N. Konbinezon fòs/deplasman an paralèl. Ki travay fòs la fè?” (A 10 kg box on the floor, pulled 3 m with a 50 N force (force parallel to displacement). What work does the force do?) – Answer: W = 50 N × 3 m = 150 J.
Scenario: “Ou kenbe yon sak 15 kg anlè a san deplase li pandan 5 segonn. Konbyen travay ou fè sou sak la pandan tan sa a?” (You hold a 15 kg bag up without moving it for 5 seconds. How much work do you do on the bag in that time?) – Answer: 0 J (no displacement).
Ask students: Give an example of a force doing negative work. (Expected: friction on a sliding object (removing kinetic energy as heat), or catching a ball (your hands apply force opposite motion to stop it, doing negative work, absorbing its kinetic energy)."
Physics,NSIII,Chapit 1: Fundamental Interactions (Entèraksyon Fondamantal),Aksyon ak Reyaksyon – Prensip Newton 3 (Action–Réaction),"Learning Objectives: State Newton’s third law in everyday language and recognize action–reaction force pairs in various situations. Understand that forces come in equal and opposite pairs between two interacting objects.
Key Concepts: Newton’s Third Law (Twazyèm lwa Newton) says tout fòs genyen yon fòs opoze egal – for every action force, there is an equal and opposite reaction force. This can be observed when two objects interact: e.g., when you push on a wall, the wall “pushes” back on you; when a balloon releases air, the air pushes out and the balloon flies back. The action and reaction act on different objects (not cancelling each other on one object).
Suggested Examples: Have a student press their hand against a wall or desk – they feel the desk pushing back. Show a balloon rocket: attach a inflated balloon on a string and let it go; as air rushes one way, the balloon shoots opposite. Discuss how a person walking is pushing backward on the ground while the ground pushes them forward. Even gravity is mutual: Earth pulls on a falling object, and the object pulls up on Earth (though Earth’s huge mass means it barely moves).
Quiz Questions:
Dekri ak pwòp mo w Lwa Aksyon-Reyaksyon Newton an. (Describe in your own words Newton’s Action-Reaction Law.)
Kilès ki “reyaksyon” lè ou komanse mache sou tè a? (Which is the “reaction” force when you begin to walk on the ground?)
Lè w sote, ou pouse tè a desann. Kisa tè a fè an retou dapre Newton? (When you jump, you push the ground down. What does the ground do in return according to Newton?)"
Physics,NSIII,Chapit 1: Fundamental Interactions (Entèraksyon Fondamantal),Entwodiksyon ak Entèraksyon Fondamantal (Interactions Fondamentales),"Learning Objectives: Identify different types of fundamental interactions (gravitational, electromagnetic, etc.) and distinguish between contact and distance forces. Understand that forces always occur in pairs (action and reaction).
Key Concepts: Objects can interact by touching (entèraksyon kontak) or at a distance (entèraksyon adistans). Gravitational attraction (attraction gravitationnelle) and magnetic/electric forces act without contact. Contact forces include tension (as in a stretched spring) and friction. Newton’s third law (Prensip aksyon-reyaksyon) states that if object A exerts a force on B, then B exerts an equal and opposite force on A.
Suggested Experiment: Hang an object from a spring (rezò̀ sòti) and observe how the spring stretches and pulls upward while gravity pulls the object downward. Drop a small water droplet into a glass of oil and watch it fall slowly – the oil’s resistance (viscous friction) and buoyant force (pousey Archimède) act on the droplet. Bring two bar magnets (aimants) close together to feel the invisible push or pull between their poles. These simple activities reinforce the idea of mutual forces between objects.
Quiz Questions:
Kisa ki diferans ant yon fòs kontak ak yon fòs ki age sou distans? (What is the difference between a contact force and a distance force?)
Bay yon egzanp kote de objè kominike san yo pa manyen. (Give an example of two objects interacting without touching.)
Si yon wòch ap trennen sou yon tab, ki entèraksyon kontak ki egziste ant wòch la ak tab la? (If a rock is dragged on a table, what contact interaction exists between the rock and the table?)"
Physics,NSIII,Chapit 1: Fundamental Interactions (Entèraksyon Fondamantal),Entèraksyon Nwayo – Fòs Fò ak Fòs Fèb (Interactions Nucléaires Fortes et Faibles),"Learning Objectives: Introduce the idea of nuclear forces (strong and weak) that act inside atoms. Understand at a basic level that these forces hold the atomic nucleus together or cause certain decays, and they operate at subatomic scales.
Key Concepts: In addition to gravity and electromagnetism, nature has two fundamental forces inside the atom: the fòs nikleyè fò (interaction forte) which binds protons and neutrons in the nucleus, and the fòs nikleyè fèb (interaction faible) which is responsible for certain types of radioactive decay. These forces act over extremely short distances (inside the atomic nucleus). The strong force is what overcomes the electromagnetic repulsion between positively charged protons to keep the nucleus intact (cohésion du noyau atomique). The weak force can cause neutrons to turn into protons or vice versa (beta decay), producing radiation. While we don’t experiment with these in class (they require nuclear reactors or particle accelerators), it’s important to know they exist to complete the picture of fundamental interactions.
Suggested Context Discussion: Show a diagram or model of an atom (with protons and neutrons tightly packed in the nucleus). Explain that protons (positively charged) normally repel, but the strong force glues them together. Mention real-world applications: nuclear energy and the Sun’s fusion rely on the strong force. Radioactive smoke detectors work due to weak-force decay (Americium-241 emitting particles). This segment is largely informational, using visuals or short videos from documentaries to illustrate concepts since direct experiments aren’t feasible in a classroom.
Quiz Questions:
Ki fòs ki kenbe pwoton ak nètron kole nan nwayo yon atòm? (Which force holds protons and neutrons together in an atom’s nucleus?)
Ki sa fòs nikleyè fèb la fè nan atòm yo? (What does the weak nuclear force do in atoms?)
Vre oswa Fo: Fòs gravitasyon an gen plis enpòtans andedan nwayo yon atòm pase fòs fò a. (True or False: Gravity is more important inside an atomic nucleus than the strong force.)"
Physics,NSIII,Chapit 1: Fundamental Interactions (Entèraksyon Fondamantal),Fòs Elektrostatik ak Elektromayetik (Forces Électrostatiques et Magnétiques),"Learning Objectives: Explore electric and magnetic interactions. Understand that like charges repel and opposite charges attract, and similarly for magnetic poles. Recognize that these are non-contact forces operating at a distance.
Key Concepts: Rubbing a balloon or comb on your hair charges it with static electricity; it can then attract small paper pieces due to fòs elektrostatik (electrostatic force). Coulomb’s law (Lwa Coulomb) governs the force between electric charges (although we may not quantify it here). Magnets have two poles (north/south); opposite poles (N-S) attract, like poles (N-N or S-S) repel. Magnetic force is an example of an electromagnetic interaction and can act through space or certain materials.
Suggested Experiment: Perform the classic static electricity demo: rub a plastic rod or comb on cloth or hair and bring it near bits of paper – observe how the paper jumps up to the comb. Use two bar magnets (de baton mayetik) and test various configurations: north pole near north pole (repulsion), north near south (attraction). Emphasize that no contact is needed; an invisible field exerts the force. These activities illustrate action-at-a-distance clearly.
Quiz Questions:
Kisa k rive lè w fwote yon balon sou cheve ou epi w pwoche li pre ti moso papye? Poukisa? (What happens when you rub a balloon on your hair and bring it near small paper bits, and why?)
Ki jan de poto mayetik yo reyaji youn ak lòt? (Nò ak Nò? Nò ak Sid?) (How do magnetic poles interact with each other? (N with N? N with S?))
Bay yon egzanp yon fòs ki ka aji san kontak fizik ant de kò. (Give an example of a force that can act without physical contact between two bodies.)"
Physics,NSIII,Chapit 1: Fundamental Interactions (Entèraksyon Fondamantal),Gravite Inivèsèl ak Òbital (Gravité Universelle et Orbites),"Learning Objectives: Understand the law of universal gravitation (lwa gravitasyon inivèsèl) and how it explains orbital motion. Explain why objects fall toward Earth and why celestial bodies (body selès) stay in orbit without falling.
Key Concepts: All masses attract each other by gravity. Newton’s law of universal gravitation (Lwa gravitasyon inivèsèl Newton) says the force of attraction grows with mass and decreases with distance. The Moon orbits the Earth, and the Earth orbits the Sun because of gravitational pull balanced by their motion. An object released near Earth (e.g. a chalk or a feather) falls to the ground due to Earth’s gravitational force. In space, satellites stay in orbit because their forward motion balances gravity’s pull, preventing them from either flying off or spiraling down.
Suggested Demonstrations: Have students gently swing a small object tied to a string in a circle (simulating orbit) and then let it go – it flies off tangentially, illustrating that without gravity’s pull it would not curve in orbit. Discuss why the Moon doesn’t “fall” to Earth: it is continuously falling toward Earth due to gravity but also moving forward, so it circles around. Use multimedia or simulations (if available) to visualize the Earth–Moon system.
Quiz Questions:
Poukisa Lalin nan pa tonbe tonbe sou Latè menm si Latè atire li? (Why doesn’t the Moon fall straight down to Earth even though Earth attracts it?)
Ki fòs ki fè yon satelit rete sou òbit otou Latè? (Which force keeps a satellite in orbit around Earth?)
Dekri kijan fòs gravitasyon an chanje si distans ant de objè ogmante. (Describe how the gravitational force changes if the distance between two objects increases.)"
Physics,NSIII,Chapit 2: Forces and Motion (Fòs ak Mouvman),Dezyèm Lwa Newton – Fòs ak Akselerasyon (Loi Fondamentale de la Dynamique),"Learning Objectives: Learn Newton’s Second Law: the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration (F = m·a). Use this law qualitatively to predict how an object’s motion changes with applied force or mass.
Key Concepts: Newton’s Second Law states that the net force (fòs rezilta) on an object equals the mass times its acceleration (F = m·a). In Creole: Fòs net la egal mas miltipliye pa akselerasyon an. This means an object’s acceleration is proportional to the net force and inversely proportional to its mass. More force yields more acceleration; more mass yields less acceleration for the same force. Units: force in newtons (N), mass in kilograms, acceleration in m/s² (we mention units lightly, focusing on concept). Also, if net force is zero, acceleration is zero (consistent with first law).
Suggested Experiment: Set up a simple cart (ti charyo) on wheels. First, push it gently with a constant force and observe its acceleration. Then add a heavy load onto the cart and push with the same force – students observe that it accelerates more slowly (greater mass, less acceleration). Alternatively, use two identical spring-loaded poppers or rubber-band slings to launch a light object (like a ping-pong ball) vs a heavier object (like a similar-sized steel ball) – the lighter one flies off with a greater acceleration. Another demo: have one student push an empty office chair vs. pushing a chair with another student sitting in it. This vividly shows mass effect.
Quiz Questions:
Dapre dezyèm lwa Newton, kisa ki rive akselerasyon yon objè si fòs la ogmante? (According to Newton’s second law, what happens to an object’s acceleration if the applied force increases?)
Si ou aplike menm fòs sou de mas diferan, youn piti youn gwo, kiyès ki pral gen pi gwo akselerasyon? Poukisa? (If you apply the same force to two different masses, one small and one large, which will have the greater acceleration, and why?)
Yon objè 2kg sibi yon akselerasyon 3 m/s². Kalkile fòs net la ki aji sou li. (An object of 2 kg experiences an acceleration of 3 m/s². Calculate the net force acting on it.) – (Expected: 6 N)"
Physics,NSIII,Chapit 2: Forces and Motion (Fòs ak Mouvman),Mouvman Sikilè ak Santripèt (Mouvement Circulaire & Force Centripète),"Learning Objectives: Recognize circular motion and understand that a centripetal force is required to sustain it. Explain everyday examples like a stone tied to a string being whirled, or the orbits of planets, using the concept of centripetal force.
Key Concepts: An object moving in a circle at constant speed is still accelerating (because direction changes), and according to Newton’s second law there must be a net force toward the center of the circle. This inward force is called fòs centripèt (centripetal force). Examples: when you swing a yo-yo in a circle, the string tension provides centripetal force toward the center; for planets orbiting the Sun, gravity is the centripetal force pulling them inward. If the centripetal force vanishes (string breaks, etc.), the object will fly off in a straight line (tangentially) due to inertia.
Suggested Demonstration: Swing a small object on a string in a horizontal circle above your head. Ask students what keeps it moving in a circle (the pull of the string). Let go of the string suddenly – the object flies off roughly straight (not outward in a spiral, illustrating inertia). Another example: bucket of water whirled in a vertical circle – at the top, the water doesn’t fall out because it’s in circular motion (demonstrating that gravity alone can act as centripetal force if speed is sufficient). If available, use a small turning platform: have a student sit and hold a weight in each hand, then spin slowly. When they pull weights inward, they spin faster – illustrating distribution of mass and needed centripetal force (though this also touches angular momentum concept). Keep it qualitative.
Quiz Questions:
Ki direksyon fòs centripèt la toujou pouse nan yon mouvman sikilè? (In what direction does the centripetal force always act in circular motion?)
Ou marinen yon wòch avèk yon kòd epi w fè l vire nan yon sèk. Kisa ki pral rive si kòd la kase toudenkou, e poukisa? (You tie a rock to a string and swing it in a circle. What happens if the string suddenly breaks, and why?)
Ki fòs k ap fè Latè vire otou Solèy la nan yon òbit sikilè apeprè? (What force makes the Earth travel around the Sun in approximately a circular orbit?)"
Physics,NSIII,Chapit 2: Forces and Motion (Fòs ak Mouvman),Sant Inèrti ak Prensip Inerzi (Centre de Masse & Principe d’Inertie),"Learning Objectives: Understand the concept of center of mass and why we can treat it as the “average” position of mass for motion analysis. Comprehend Newton’s First Law (Law of Inertia) – an object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in uniform motion unless acted on by a net force.
Key Concepts: The sant de mas (center of mass) of an object is the point that moves as if all the mass were concentrated there. When analyzing translational motion, we often track the center of mass. Newton’s First Law (Prensip Inerzi) says if no net force acts on a system, its center of mass either remains at rest or moves in a straight line at constant speed. This law introduces the concept of inertia: the natural tendency of objects to resist changes in motion. Inertia depends on mass (mass is a measure of inertia – objects with more mass resist acceleration more).
Experiment (Inertia Demonstration): Place a small marble (boul) on a smooth surface (like a polished mirror or tile). Give it a gentle push – it rolls at constant speed in a straight line until friction (or hitting a wall) stops it. This illustrates motion with no (or minimal) net force. Next, show inertia at rest: do the classic “tablecloth pull” trick (carefully yank a sheet of paper or cloth out from under a cup); the cup’s inertia keeps it nearly in place. Alternatively, place a coin on a card atop a glass and flick the card – the coin drops into the glass once the card is gone. Discuss how these demonstrate that without an external force, the state of motion doesn’t change.
Quiz Questions:
Ki prensip fizikal ki eksplike poukisa ou santi ou pouse nan do chèz la lè yon machin akselere? (Which physical principle explains why you feel pushed back into your seat when a car accelerates?)
Kisa “inerzi” vle di, e kijan li gen rapò ak mas yon kò? (What does “inertia” mean, and how is it related to an object’s mass?)
Si pa gen okenn fòs ki aji sou yon boul ki deplase sou yon sifas, ki jan boul la ap deplase selon lwa premye Newton nan? (If no force acts on a ball rolling on a surface, how will the ball move according to Newton’s first law?)"
Physics,NSIII,Chapit 2: Forces and Motion (Fòs ak Mouvman),Translasyon kont Wotasyon (Mouvement de Translation vs Rotation),"Learning Objectives: Distinguish between translational motion (moving without rotating) and rotational motion. Identify examples of each and situations where both occur simultaneously.
Key Concepts: Mouvman translasyon is when an object moves along a path (straight or curved) but does not spin – every point on the object moves in the same way. Mouvman wotasyon is when an object spins around an axis. Example: A car wheel rotates, while the car itself translates down the road. An object can do both at once (e.g. Earth rotates on its axis and translates around the Sun). A rigid body’s motion can be seen as translation of its center of mass plus possibly rotation about the center of mass. In a truck carrying a tractor: the tractor (on the flatbed) moves purely in translation along with the truck, while the truck’s wheels undergo rotation (and the truck as a whole translates).
Suggested Demonstration: Show a toy car with a piece of tape on one wheel. Push it forward: the tape goes round (rotational motion of wheel) while the car (and tape’s center) moves forward (translation). Have students differentiate the motion of the wheel vs. the whole toy. Another demo: spin a fidget spinner (pure rotation), slide a book across a table without spinning (pure translation), then roll a ball (translation + rotation). These examples help students identify each type of motion in everyday contexts.
Quiz Questions:

Physics,NSIII,Chapit 3: Work and Energy (Travay ak Enèji),Degradasyon Enèji ak Chalè (Dégradation de l’Énergie & Chaleur),"Learning Objectives: Introduce the concept of energy “loss” through conversion to heat (internal energy). Emphasize that energy is conserved overall, but mechanical energy can degrade into less useful forms (thermal energy). Relate this to the idea of energy efficiency.
Key Concepts: When friction or other resistive forces act, mechanical energy (organized energy of motion) is transformed into chalè (heat), which is the random kinetic energy of molecules (internal energy). For example, rubbing hands or sliding a box on the floor generates warmth – mechanical work is converted to internal energy of the surfaces. This is often called degradasyon enèji because organized energy becomes disordered thermal energy. Energy is still conserved, but it’s now in a form less able to do mechanical work. Efficiency (randman) of a machine is the fraction of input energy that goes into useful output (the rest often ends up as heat). Real systems always produce some heat; no process is 100% efficient.
Suggested Experiment: Press your palms together and vigorously rub them – students feel the temperature rise as mechanical work turns into heat in their skin (friction). Another simple activity: use a hand-crank generator or even a dynamo flashlight – after use, feel that it gets warm, illustrating electrical/mechanical energy partially turning to heat due to internal resistance. If available, show a thermometer or thermal camera when doing mechanical work (even hammering a nail warms the nail). A classic demo: quickly bend a paperclip back and forth – it breaks and the ends are hot. All these underscore that when mechanical energy seems to “disappear,” it has actually converted to internal energy (raising temperature).

Physics,NSIII,Chapit 3: Work and Energy (Travay ak Enèji),Enèji Potansyèl ak Konsèvasyon Enèji (Énergie Potentielle & Conservation),"Learning Objectives: Understand gravitational potential energy (enèji potansyèl gravitasyonèl) and other forms of stored energy. Learn the principle of mechanical energy conservation in the absence of non-conservative forces (energy transforming between kinetic and potential forms).
Key Concepts: Énergie Potentielle (Ep) is energy stored by position or configuration. For gravity, an object of mass $m$ at height $h$ has $E_p = m g h$ relative to a reference level (more height = more potential energy). When it falls, $E_p$ decreases and converts into $E_k$ (kinetic) – illustrating energy transformation. In absence of air resistance or friction, the enèji mekanik (mechanical energy = $E_k + E_p$) of a system remains constant (Conservation of mechanical energy). Example: a pendulum at its highest point has max potential, zero kinetic; at the lowest point, minimum potential, max kinetic – total stays roughly the same. If friction is present, some mechanical energy turns into internal energy (heat) instead, so mechanical energy is not fully conserved (but overall energy is conserved).
Suggested Experiment: Perform a simple pendulum or ball-drop experiment. Measure the drop height and the speed upon impact (using a stopwatch for a short drop or simple timing for a pendulum swing). Show that a ball dropped from 1 m height will not bounce back to the original height – the missing energy went into heating the floor and ball (and sound). If you have a spring and weight, show spring potential energy converting to kinetic: compress the spring with the weight, release – it jumps (spring Ep → Kinetic → gravitational Ep as it rises). Alternatively, use simulation or video of a roller coaster to illustrate potential-kinetic interchange.

Physics,NSIII,Chapit 3: Work and Energy (Travay ak Enèji),Pouvwa ak Randman (Puissance & Rendement),"Learning Objectives: Define power (puissance) as the rate of energy transfer or work done per second. Compare scenarios by power output (e.g. a strong engine vs a weak engine). Introduce the concept of efficiency (randman) in energy conversion – not all input energy becomes useful work.
Key Concepts: Puissance is measured in watts (W), with 1 W = 1 joule/second. It tells how fast work is done or energy is used. For example, a 100 W lightbulb converts 100 J of electrical energy to light (and heat) each second. An athlete climbing stairs quickly develops more power than one climbing slowly (same work, less time). Rendement (efficiency) is the fraction of input energy that is converted to useful output energy or work, often expressed as a percentage. If a machine has 30% efficiency, 70% of the energy is lost as heat or other forms. High-efficiency devices waste less energy.
Suggested Activity: Have two students lift identical books to a shelf – one does it slowly, the other quickly. They perform roughly the same work (increase potential energy of the book) but the faster student demonstrates greater power output (same joules in less time). To illustrate efficiency, discuss common devices: an incandescent bulb gets very hot (much energy to heat, little to light, maybe ~5% efficient as light); LED bulb is much cooler (far more efficient). If possible, use a simple DC motor with a weight: measure how much battery energy it uses to lift the weight vs the increase in potential energy of weight (calculating efficiency). Or just conceptually compare a car’s engine: only a portion of fuel energy moves the car, the rest is wasted as heat.

Physics,NSIII,Chapit 3: Work and Energy (Travay ak Enèji),Travay Fòs ak Enèji Sinetik (Travail d’une Force & Énergie Cinétique),"Learning Objectives: Define the work done by a force (travay yon fòs) and relate it to the kinetic energy gained or lost by an object. Understand kinetic energy (enèji sinetik – energy of motion) and how work can increase or decrease it.
Key Concepts: When a force moves an object over a distance, it does travay (work) on that object, transferring energy. For example, lifting an object increases its energy (you do positive work against gravity), and friction doing work can take energy out as heat. Énergie cinétique (Ek) is $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ – the energy an object has due to its velocity. Work–Energy Theorem: the net work done on an object equals the change in its kinetic energy. If you throw a ball, the work your hand’s force does increases the ball’s kinetic energy. If friction (e.g. brakes on a car) does negative work, it reduces kinetic energy (the energy converts to heat in brakes).
Suggested Experiment: Set up a small ramp and release a toy car from rest at the top. Measure or mark how far it travels on a flat surface. Now push the car to give it an extra boost down the ramp – it goes faster and travels farther. Discuss: your push did additional work, increasing kinetic energy, so it went further against friction. Another demo: Swing a pendulum bob and let it hit a lightweight object (like a cup or block) at the bottom – if swung from a higher point (more work done by gravity, more speed at bottom), it knocks the object further. These show more work in → more kinetic energy → more effect.

Physics,NSIII,Chapit 4: Thermodynamics (Tèmodinamik),Chalè ak Tanperati (Chaleur et Température),"Learning Objectives: Distinguish clearly between heat (chalè) and temperature (tanperati). Understand that temperature measures how hot/cold something is (related to average kinetic energy of particles), while heat is energy transferred due to temperature difference. Learn common temperature scales (Celsius) and how a thermometer works.
Key Concepts: Tanperati is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance – it indicates how hot or cold an object is. Chalè (heat) is energy in transit from a hotter body to a colder body. When you touch a warm object, heat flows into your hand. Units: temperature in °C (or K), heat energy in joules or calories. A thermometer works by thermal expansion: e.g., mercury or colored alcohol in a glass tube expands as it gets warmer, rising up the tube to indicate temperature. Temperature is an intensive property (doesn’t depend on amount), whereas heat is extensive (depends on mass, etc.).
Suggested Experiment: Make a simple thermometer: Fill a narrow-neck bottle with colored water and insert a straw sealed at the neck. When the bottle is warmed (by hands or warm water bath), the water expands and rises up the straw, demonstrating thermal expansion and how a thermometer indicates temperature. Also, demonstrate mixing hot and cold water: have students predict the resulting temperature (it will be intermediate – heat flows from hot to cold until equilibrium). Use everyday context: measure your body temperature with a thermometer, discuss fever ~37°C etc., and note how the thermometer must absorb heat to rise to body temperature.

Physics,NSIII,Chapit 4: Thermodynamics (Tèmodinamik),Dilatasyon Tèmik (Dilatation Thermique),"Learning Objectives: Understand that most materials expand (dilate) when heated and contract when cooled. Examine thermal expansion in solids, liquids, and gases and learn some practical consequences (loose lids opening under hot water, gaps in bridges for expansion, etc.).
Key Concepts: Heating a material increases the vibration of its particles and causes it to expand – this is dilatasyon tèmik (thermal expansion). Solids have a fixed shape but still expand a little when hot (e.g., metal rails or a heated wire gets longer). Liquids expand more than solids for the same temperature change (this is why a thermometer works – liquid level goes up when temp rises). Gases expand a lot when heated if not confined, or if confined, their pressure rises (relation between temperature, volume, and pressure explored more in next video). The expansion is usually linear for small temperature changes: $\Delta L = \alpha L_0 \Delta T$ for a rod (for understanding, not heavy emphasis on formula). Real-life: glass jar lids loosen under hot water because the metal lid expands; power lines sag more on hot days; a hot air balloon rises because heating air causes expansion (lower density).
Suggested Experiment: Ball and ring demo: If available, use a metal ball and ring apparatus. At room temp, the ball just passes through the ring. Heat the ball (with hot water or flame carefully) and it will no longer pass – it expanded. Cool it (in cold water) and it fits again. Alternatively, heat a metal strip with a bimetallic strip or a simple thermostat demo – it bends as different metals expand differently. A simpler home experiment: take a metal jar lid that is tight on a glass jar, immerse just the lid in hot water – after a minute, it loosens (metal expanded). Even without fancy tools, students can observe a balloon: inflate a balloon and tie it; then place it in hot sun or warm water – it expands (or in a freezer – it shrinks). Chart observations of expansion.

Physics,NSIII,Chapit 4: Thermodynamics (Tèmodinamik),Konpwesibilite ak Presyon Gaz (Gaz Compressibles & Pression),"Learning Objectives: Discover how gases differ from solids and liquids in compressibility and response to temperature changes. Understand qualitatively the relationships between pressure, volume, and temperature of a gas (no heavy formulas, just concepts of Boyle’s law and Charles’ law in words).
Key Concepts: Gases are highly konpresib (compressible) – you can squeeze a gas into a smaller volume (unlike liquids/solids which are nearly incompressible). Presyon (pressure) is the force per area the gas exerts on container walls due to molecules hitting the walls. If you decrease a gas’s volume (compress it) and keep temperature constant, pressure increases (molecules hit walls more often) – this is Boyle’s Law qualitatively. If you heat a gas in a fixed volume, its pressure rises; if you allow it to expand, it will expand in volume – hot gas has more energy so molecules move faster and push outward (Charles’ Law qualitatively). Everyday example: a sealed bag of chips swells up in the sun (gas pressure increases with heat). Also: when you pump a bicycle tire, it gets warm – compressing gas increases pressure and temperature (doing work on the gas adds energy). Atmospheric pressure is due to the weight of air above us; at higher altitude pressure is lower (less air above).
Suggested Experiment: Balloon and flask demo: Take an empty plastic bottle and place a balloon over its mouth. Place the bottle in hot water – the balloon inflates slightly as the air inside expands. Place it in ice water – the balloon deflates (air contracts). This shows expansion of gas with temperature. Another simple one: use a syringe (without needle) with the outlet capped – push the plunger in and feel resistance (compressing gas raises pressure), release and it pushes back. Or illustrate with a Cartesian diver: in a closed bottle with an eyedropper (with air) floating, squeezing the bottle compresses the air in the dropper, making it sink (pressure increase causes volume decrease). These hands-on activities connect to gas laws qualitatively.

Physics,NSIII,Chapit 4: Thermodynamics (Tèmodinamik),"Transfè Chalè – Konduksyon, Konveksyon, Radyasyon (Transfert de Chaleur)","Learning Objectives: Describe the three modes of heat transfer: conduction (konduksyon), convection (konveksyon), and radiation (radyasyon). Identify examples of each in daily life. Understand insulators vs conductors.
Key Concepts: Konduksyon (conduction) is heat transfer through direct contact – fast-moving particles collide with neighbors, transferring energy. Solids, especially metals, are good conductors (konduktè tèmik); that’s why a metal spoon gets hot quickly in soup. Konveksyon (convection) is heat transfer by the movement of fluids (liquids or gases); warmer regions become less dense and rise, cooler regions sink, setting up convection currents (e.g., boiling water circulates, warm air rises). Radyasyon (radiation) is transfer by electromagnetic waves (infrared, etc.) – no medium needed (the Sun’s heat reaches us through vacuum). All objects emit some thermal radiation. Example: feeling warmth from a fire without touching it (radiation); the circulation of hot air from a heater (convection); a spoon heating in a hot drink (conduction). Insulators (isolant tèmik) like wood or Styrofoam slow conduction, while shiny surfaces can reflect radiation.
Suggested Experiment: Conduction demo: Take two rods of different materials (metal vs wood or plastic). Put one end of each in hot water. After a minute, feel the other ends (metal will be warm, plastic not much) – illustrates conduction and thermal conductivity difference. Convection demo: Add a drop of food coloring to water in a clear beaker and gently heat from below – observe the colored plumes rising and circulating as convection cells. Or simpler, show that when water is heated at bottom it circulates, but if heated at top it may not mix well. Radiation demo: On a sunny day, compare warming of a black paper vs white paper placed under the sun (black absorbs radiation more, gets hotter). Or feel the heat lamp vs ambient. Even holding hands near (not touching) a warm cup feels warmth via radiation.

Physics,NSIII,Chapit 5: Oscillations (Oscilasyon),Damping ak Rezònans (Amortissement & Résonance),"Learning Objectives: Introduce the ideas of damping (amortissement) – how oscillations gradually die out due to friction/resistance – and resonance (résonance) – how an oscillator can be driven to large amplitude if periodic forces match its natural frequency. These are more advanced, but giving a conceptual taste to students with simple examples to enrich their understanding of oscillations.
Key Concepts: Damping (amortissement) refers to any effect, like friction or air resistance, that gradually reduces the amplitude of oscillation over time. For instance, a pendulum in air eventually stops because air resistance removes energy each swing. A car’s shock absorbers provide damping to stop the car from bouncing excessively. Resonance is when a periodic driving force has a frequency equal to an object’s natural frequency, causing large amplitude oscillations. Example: pushing someone on a swing – if you push at just the right frequency (each time they come back), the swing’s amplitude grows. Another famous example: soldiers breaking step on a bridge to avoid resonant vibrations, or a singer shattering a glass by singing its resonance note. We keep it qualitative: resonance can be useful (like in musical instruments) or harmful (vibrations in machinery if not controlled).
Suggested Demonstration: Damping: Attach a cardboard “flag” to a pendulum bob to increase air resistance – observe that it stops much sooner than a normal pendulum (heavy damping). Or have a cup of water and oscillate a hand in it (water resistance damps quickly). Resonance: Set up two identical pendulums (same length) hanging from a common support (like a stick) and one or two with different lengths. Start one pendulum swinging; after a while, you’ll see the other pendulum of the same length start to swing significantly (energy transfers through support at resonant frequency), whereas the different-length ones stay still or barely move. Alternatively, place a ruler on a table edge and pluck it – it vibrates at a natural frequency (shorter length vibrates faster). Show that if you tap at that frequency, amplitude grows, but at a wrong frequency, it doesn’t. Keep it fun: maybe demonstrate the classic “Tacoma Narrows Bridge” video for resonance (if resources allow).

Physics,NSIII,Chapit 5: Oscillations (Oscilasyon),Mouvman Pendil – Entwodiksyon a Oscilasyon (Pendule & Oscillations),"Learning Objectives: Introduce oscillatory motion using a simple pendulum (pandil) as an example. Define one oscillation, the period (peryòd) of oscillation, and frequency (frekans). Show that oscillations repeat in time and are characterized by amplitude.
Key Concepts: An oscilasyon is one complete back-and-forth movement. For a pendulum, that could be from one extreme, over to the other extreme, and back again. Peryòd la (period) is the time for one oscillation (seconds per cycle), and frekans lan (frequency) is the number of oscillations per second (measured in hertz, Hz). They are inversely related: $f = 1/T$. The amplitid is the maximum displacement from equilibrium (how far it swings from center). A pendulum’s period is independent of the swing amplitude if amplitude is small (approximately true for small angles) – this is an interesting property. Also, the period of a pendulum depends on its length: a longer pendulum swings slower (larger $T$). Mass of the bob doesn’t significantly affect the period (for pendulum), which can surprise students. These principles apply to any periodic motion (mass on spring, etc., though details differ).
Suggested Experiment: Create a simple pendulum with a string and a small weight. Have students measure the time for, say, 10 swings and divide to find the period. Test different string lengths: a very short pendulum vs a longer one – observe the longer one swings more slowly (longer period). Also, try different amplitudes (small swing vs a bigger swing) – surprisingly, the period stays almost the same (for small angles), which can be shown qualitatively by starting two pendulums of same length at different amplitudes and seeing they stay in sync for a while. Optionally, change the bob mass (tie a heavier object) – period doesn’t change much, illustrating mass independence.

Physics,NSIII,Chapit 5: Oscillations (Oscilasyon),Prentan ak Mass – Vibrasyon Sous (Ressort & Masse),"Learning Objectives: Examine another oscillator: a mass on a spring. Understand how the mass and spring stiffness affect the oscillation period. Reinforce concepts of equilibrium position, amplitude, period, and energy exchange between potential and kinetic in oscillations.
Key Concepts: A mass attached to a spring (sous) can oscillate vertically or horizontally. When pulled and released, it bounces up and down. The peryòd of a mass-spring oscillator is determined by the mass ($m$) and the spring constant ($k$) – qualitatively: a heavier mass oscillates more slowly (longer period), and a stiffer spring (plis rèd) oscillates faster (shorter period). The formula (not mandatory to memorize, but for teacher’s info) is $T = 2\pi \sqrt{m/k}$. The motion involves energy conversion: spring potential energy (enèji potansyèl sous) <-> kinetic energy, like a pendulum exchanges gravitational potential <-> kinetic. At equilibrium, speed is maximal and spring either relaxed or in motion; at endpoints, speed zero and spring stretched/compressed (max potential). This is another example of simple harmonic motion (Mouvman Amonik Senp).
Suggested Experiment: Use a hanging spring with weights. Pull it down slightly and release to let it bounce. Measure the period with a stopwatch for a given mass. Then change the mass (add more weight) – students observe it oscillates slower (count fewer oscillations in same time). Also possibly use springs of different stiffness (if available or simulate by using two springs in parallel to make stiffer) – a stiffer spring oscillates faster. If a motion sensor or phone app is available, plot position vs time to see the sine-wave pattern. Even without tech, visually note that the motion is symmetric and periodic. Emphasize careful: don’t overstretch the spring (stay in elastic range).
Quiz Questions:

Physics,NSIII,Chapit 6: Waves (Ondes),Entèferans ak Refleksyon Ond (Interférences et Réflexion),"Learning Objectives: Explain what happens when two waves meet (interference), including the concepts of constructive and destructive interference in simple terms. Discuss wave reflection from fixed and open boundaries. Although these can be complex, use simple scenarios (two pebbles in water creating ripples, echoes for sound reflection) to illustrate principles qualitatively.
Key Concepts: Entèferans (interference) occurs when two or more waves overlap in the same region. If the crests of two waves meet, they add up to a higher crest (entèferans konstriktif – constructive interference); if a crest meets a trough, they can cancel each other (entèferans destriktif – destructive interference). Interference is easiest observed in water waves (overlapping ripples) or sound (two speakers playing same tone can have loud and soft spots). Refleksyon (reflection): waves bounce off boundaries. A pulse on a rope reflects inverted if the end is fixed (comes back upside down), and upright if the end is free to move. Echoes are sound reflections off walls or mountains (sound wave comes back to you). Light reflects off mirrors similarly. We also have refraksyon (refraction) – waves bending when entering a new medium – but that might be covered under optics; here we focus on interference and reflection which are fundamental wave behaviors. Emphasize that interference does not destroy energy; in destructive interference energy is redistributed (e.g., in other locations).
Suggested Demonstration: Water ripple tank (if available): drop two pebbles simultaneously in a tray of water at different points – observe the overlapping ripples and identify regions where waves seem to cancel (water calmer) vs reinforce (bigger ripples). If no ripple tank, use a rope: generate two pulses from opposite ends at the same time – when they meet in middle, briefly they superimpose (you might see a larger displacement if in phase, or a momentary cancellation if one is inverted – though rope pulses inverted reflection can show partial cancelation). For reflection: fix one end of a rope and send a pulse, watch it invert upon return; tie a loose ring on the end of rope (approx. free end) and send a pulse, see it return upright. For sound, to demonstrate interference is tricky in class without equipment; you might skip detailed quantification. But definitely demonstrate an echo: even clapping in a large room or hallway and hearing the reflection. Or use a long tube: make a sound and hear the reflection if tube is closed at one end. These make the ideas concrete.

Illustration: Two waves overlapping (yellow and blue) creating an interference pattern. When the peaks align (constructive interference), a larger amplitude (green) results; when a peak meets a trough (destructive interference), they cancel out partially. This demonstrates how wave interference can amplify or diminish the resulting wave."
Physics,NSIII,Chapit 6: Waves (Ondes),Kisa Yon Ond Ye? (Qu’est-ce qu’une Onde?),"Learning Objectives: Define a wave as a disturbance that propagates through a medium (or space) carrying energy without permanent transport of matter. Differentiate between mechanical waves (which require a medium, e.g. sound, water waves) and electromagnetic waves (which do not require a medium, e.g. light). Classify waves as transverse or longitudinal based on the motion of the medium relative to wave direction.
Key Concepts: A onde is a repeating disturbance that travels. Mechanical waves (onde mekanik) need a medium – e.g., sound needs air, water waves need water – and cannot travel through vacuum. Electromagnetic waves (onde elektwomayetik) (light, radio, etc.) do not need a medium; they can travel through vacuum (eg. sunlight reaches Earth through space). In a onde transverse, the medium’s particles move perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation (like a wave on a rope – the rope moves up/down while the wave travels forward). In a onde longitudinal, particles move back-and-forth in the same direction the wave travels (like sound in air – air molecules vibrate left-right as compression waves move left-right). Waves carry energy: a strong wave can do damage (ocean waves breaking, loud sound shattering glass), but overall the medium itself mostly oscillates around an equilibrium position.
Suggested Demonstration: Rope demo: Take a long rope or slinky spring. Have one student hold one end and another hold the other end. Create a pulse by flicking one end up and down once – watch it travel. Then generate continuous waves by shaking rhythmically. Show transverse motion on a rope (mark a piece of tape on the rope – it moves up/down as the wave goes forward). Slinky demo: Place a slinky on a smooth floor; push and pull one end to create compression pulses – students see compressions travel along (longitudinal wave). Emphasize that the coils themselves just vibrate in place. Also, if available, demonstrate that sound cannot travel in a vacuum: use a buzzer inside a jar and evacuate air (or simpler: mention the classic bell-jar demo), confirming mechanical waves need a medium.

Physics,NSIII,Chapit 6: Waves (Ondes),"Pwopriyete Ond – Anplitid, Longèdonn, Frekans, Vitès (Propriétés des Ondes)","Learning Objectives: Identify and define key wave properties: amplitude (anplitid), wavelength (longèdonn), frequency (frekans), and wave speed (vitès onde). Understand the relationship between wave speed, frequency, and wavelength (v = f·λ). Use diagrams of waves to locate crests, troughs, and measure wavelengths.
Key Concepts: Anplitid is the maximum displacement of the medium from equilibrium – related to the wave’s energy (a larger amplitude means a stronger wave carrying more energy). Longèdonn (wavelength, λ) is the distance between two corresponding points on consecutive cycles of a wave (e.g., crest to crest, or compression to compression). Frekans is the number of cycles per second (Hz), and peryòd is the time for one cycle (as covered earlier). The vitès of a wave is how fast the disturbance travels through the medium – for a given medium, often constant for small disturbances. The relation: $v = \lambda \times f$. For example, if a wave has 2 m wavelength and frequency 5 Hz, its speed is 10 m/s. In a rope or slinky, you can observe that if you shake slower (lower f), the wavelength increases for the same medium (since the speed is fixed by the medium tension and mass density), and vice versa. Distinguish crests (pik onde) and troughs (kavite onde) in transverse waves. In longitudinal waves, talk about compressions (konpresyon) and rarefactions (rarefaksyon) as analogous points.
Suggested Demonstration: Use the rope or slinky again: create a standing wave or clear waves and have students measure wavelength (e.g. mark two consecutive crests distance). Change frequency of shaking: when you shake faster, you’ll see more waves (shorter wavelength) between the ends. For a quantitative demo: measure the length of 5 waves and divide by 5 to get λ, count how many oscillations in 10 seconds to get f, then see if v = f·λ roughly holds by comparison. Alternatively, use a simulation or computer animation to illustrate wave parameters clearly (PhET “Wave on a String” is a great tool if available). Also demonstrate how amplitude is independent of frequency – you can shake the rope with small or large amplitude without changing wavelength or frequency of the source (amplitude mainly affects energy, not speed or frequency which are source/medium dependent).

Physics,NSIII,Chapit 7: Sound (Son),Anplasman ak Entansite – Frekans ak Anplitid Son (Hauteur et Intensité Sonore),"Learning Objectives: Relate the frequency of a sound wave to its perceived pitch (anplasman son). Relate the amplitude (or sound pressure) of a wave to its loudness (entansite). Discuss the range of human hearing in frequency and the concept of ultrasound/infrasound. Introduce decibels as a unit for sound level (qualitatively).
Key Concepts: Pitch (hauteur ou “ton”) of a sound is determined by its frequency: high frequency = high-pitched sound (frekans wo, son pi fen, e.g. a whistle), low frequency = low pitch (frekans ba, son grav, e.g. a bass drum). Humans hear roughly from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz (20 kHz) when young; frequencies above 20 kHz are ultrasons (ultrasound) and below 20 Hz are infrasons (infrasound) – we usually cannot hear those. Loudness relates to amplitude of the sound wave (and energy); technically to sound intensity (power per area) and measured in decibels (dB). A larger amplitude compression means the air pressure variation is greater, which we hear as a louder sound. Decibel scale is logarithmic; we won’t delve deep, but note conversational speech ~60 dB, rock concert ~110 dB, etc. Prolonged exposure above ~85 dB can damage hearing. Also, loudness perception is subjective and also frequency-dependent, but we keep it simple: amplitude → loudness, frequency → pitch. Demonstrate that pitch and loudness are independent: you can have a high-pitched soft sound or a low-pitched loud sound.
Suggested Experiment: Hearing test tones: If resources allow, play audio tones of different frequencies (e.g. 500 Hz vs 1000 Hz vs 5000 Hz) at same volume – have students identify which is higher pitch. Then play a single frequency tone but at different volumes to illustrate loud/soft distinction. Alternatively, use musical instruments: a small guitar or violin string (short, high frequency) vs a longer or thicker string (lower frequency) – pluck softly vs strongly to separate pitch vs loudness. Use a phone with a frequency generator app if available to output pure tones. Another fun demo: fill glass bottles with different water levels and blow across the top – each produces a different pitch (the air column length changes frequency). For amplitude: demonstrate with a speaker and oscilloscope app or just by ear: increasing the amplifier volume increases the amplitude, thus loudness, without changing the pitch of a note.

Physics,NSIII,Chapit 7: Sound (Son),Gaye Son – Vitès Son ak Eko (Propagation du Son & Écho),"Learning Objectives: Discuss the speed of sound in various media and factors affecting it (temperature, medium density/elasticity). Explain the phenomenon of echo and how sound reflection can be used to measure distance (echolocation, sonar).
Key Concepts: The vitès son in air at room temperature (~20°C) is about 340 m/s . Sound travels faster in warmer air (e.g., ~350 m/s at 30°C) because particles move faster. In water, sound speed is ~1500 m/s, and in solids like steel it can be ~5000 m/s. So generally: solid > liquid > gas, because stiffness of medium (elasticity) contributes to higher speed, and lower compressibility yields higher speed. Unlike light (~300,000 km/s), sound is much slower – hence we see lightning before thunder, and we can sometimes notice delay between events and their sounds. Echo: a reflected sound that is heard separately from the original sound. For an echo to be heard distinctly, the reflecting surface must be far enough that the round-trip time > 0.1s (since human persistence of hearing ~0.1s). That corresponds to about 17 m one-way distance (because in 0.1 s sound goes ~34 m, meaning 17 m out and 17 m back). Bats and dolphins use ultrasonic echoes (echolocation) to navigate and find prey. Humans use sonar (SOund Navigation And Ranging) – e.g., ships measuring ocean depth by timing echoes (depth = (speed * time)/2). Also, in a canyon or large empty space, you can hear your echo by shouting.
Suggested Demonstration: If possible, perform a simple echo activity: have students clap or shout near a large wall at some distance (like in a school courtyard or hallway) and listen for the reflected sound. Or use a short pulse sound and listen for a faint repeat (this can be subtle in small spaces). Alternatively, cite relatable experiences: yelling in a canyon, echo in a big empty room, sonar pings from documentaries. For speed of sound, a cool demo: synchronize claps – Have one student stand ~100 m away (if outdoors) and hit two wood blocks together, another student halfway. Observers far away might see the hit before hearing it. Or simply demonstrate that light is effectively instantaneous at short range while sound lags: use a camera flash and a sound (like a starter pistol or popping a balloon) at a distance – the flash is seen before the bang is heard. If safe and possible: pop a balloon at ~50 m and note delay. If not, just describe lightning/thunder timing method to estimate distance of storm (every 3 seconds ~1 km).
Quiz Questions:
Nan ki mwayen son vwayaje pi vit: lè, dlo, oswa fè? (In which medium does sound travel faster: air, water, or iron?)
Pouki nou wè ḳoy nan syèl la anvan nou tande loraj la pandan yon tanpèt loraj? (Why do we see lightning before we hear thunder during a thunderstorm?)

(If you hear an echo 2 seconds after you shout, about how far away is the reflecting surface (round-trip)? Assume sound speed ≈ 340 m/s.) – (Expected: ~340 m/s * 2 s = 680 m total, so one-way ~340 m.)"
Physics,NSIII,Chapit 7: Sound (Son),Nati Son – Vag Longitudinal (Nature du Son & Ondes Longitudinales),"Learning Objectives: Understand that sound is a vibration traveling through a medium as a longitudinal wave of compressions and rarefactions. Explain that sound cannot travel in a vacuum (no medium, no sound). Identify sources of sound as vibrating objects (guitar string, vocal cords, speaker cone, etc.).
Key Concepts: Son is a mechanical wave; typically longitudinal in gases and liquids (air molecules oscillate back and forth to carry sound). A tuning fork or speaker diaphragm vibrates, creating regions of slightly higher pressure (compressions) and lower pressure (rarefactions) that move outward. Sound requires a medium: it travels through air, liquids, solids, but not through empty space. In solids, sound can also have transverse components (like vibrations in a metal rod), but in fluids it’s purely longitudinal. The speed of sound in air at room temperature is about 340 m/s . It travels faster in liquids (~1500 m/s in water) and even faster in solids (e.g., ~5000 m/s in steel), because the particles are more tightly bonded. We perceive sound when these vibrations reach our ears and make the eardrum vibrate in turn.
Suggested Demonstration: Bell in a vacuum (if possible): Show or describe the classic experiment: a ringing alarm clock or bell is placed under a glass jar; as air is pumped out, the sound fades until nearly silent – proving sound needs a medium. Simple visualization: use a slinky spring to mimic sound waves: have students observe compressions traveling. Alternatively, stretch a balloon or drum membrane with some sand on it and speak or play music through a phone near it – the sand jumps, showing vibrations. Or use a tuning fork: strike it and touch its end to surface of water – ripples form, indicating vibration. A thin plastic ruler half off a desk can be twanged to make a sound and visibly vibrate. These link the idea of vibration and sound generation.
Quiz Questions:
Kòman son pwodui epi kouman li pwopaje nan lè a? (How is sound produced and how does it propagate through the air?)

Ki fòm onde son yo pran nan lè a, epi kijan sa diferan ak vag sou yon kòd? (What form do sound waves take in air, and how is that different from waves on a string?)"
Physics,NSIII,Chapit 7: Sound (Son),"Son an Pratik – Enstriman, Orèy imen, & Sonò (Applications Sonores)","Learning Objectives: Explore practical aspects of sound: how musical instruments produce different sounds, how the human ear detects sound, and examples of technology using sound (like ultrasound imaging or sonar). This lesson ties together concepts by applying them in real-world contexts.
Key Concepts: Musical instruments create sound by making something vibrate – strings on a guitar/violin, air column in a flute (kòn an bwa), lips buzzing in a trumpet, membranes in drums. The pitch is controlled by size/tension: shorter or tighter strings give higher pitch, longer air columns give lower pitch (like covering holes on a flute changes effective length). The timbre (timbre sonò) of an instrument – why a guitar and piano playing same note sound different – comes from waveforms and overtones (harmonics), which is beyond basics but can be mentioned: instruments produce complex waves (superposition of many frequencies). The human ear: sound waves enter ear canal, vibrate eardrum (tympanum), which moves the tiny ossicle bones, transmitting vibrations to the cochlea where hair cells convert to nerve signals. Our ears can detect tiny pressure changes but have limits (hence loud sounds can damage hair cells). Sonar/Ultrasound: sonar on boats sends out pulses of ultrasound and measures echo time to map ocean floor or detect fish. Doctors use ultrasound (high-frequency sound ~ millions of Hz, beyond hearing) to image inside the body safely – echoes differ from various tissues. Bats and dolphins naturally use ultrasound echolocation to “see” in dark or murky water. These applications show sound’s versatility.
Suggested Activity: If possible, bring a guitar or any simple instrument to class. Show how changing string tension or length (pressing frets) changes pitch. Or use a set of water-filled bottles (xylophone) – different fill levels produce different pitches when blown or tapped. To demonstrate resonance in instruments: show a tuning fork resonating over a sound box or near a piano string of the same frequency (if available) – it will make the string sound by resonance. For the ear, perhaps display a poster or diagram of the ear anatomy to point out parts (eardrum, cochlea). If resources allow, a small buzzer and a stethoscope can simulate ultrasound coupling (though medical ultrasound is more advanced). Mentioning that unlike X-rays, ultrasound is non-ionizing, hence safer. If there’s a bat detector device or an app that plays ultrasound, one could demonstrate we cannot hear it but maybe see effects (most likely just conceptual discussion).
Quiz Questions:

Physics,NSIII,Chapit 8: Electric Circuits (Sikwi Éléktrik),"Baz Sikwi – Kouran, Tansyon, Rezistans (Courant, Tension, Résistance)","Learning Objectives: Introduce the basic quantities in electricity: electric current (kouran elektrik), voltage (tansyon elektrik), and resistance (rezistans). Understand that current is a flow of charges (electrons) around a circuit, driven by a voltage (from a battery or power supply). Ohm’s Law (Lwa Ohm) is introduced conceptually: $V = I \times R$, relating voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R).
Key Concepts: Kouran elektrik (I) is the rate of charge flow, measured in amperes (amps, A). It’s like the flow of water in a pipe – more current means more charge passing per second. Tansyon oswa vòltaj (V) is the electrical “pressure” or potential difference provided by a battery or power source, measured in volts (V). It pushes the charges through the circuit. Rezistans (R) is how much a component resists the flow of current, measured in ohms (Ω). A resistor (like a bulb filament) limits current; higher resistance, less current for a given voltage. Ohm’s Law: if you increase the voltage across a resistor, the current increases proportionally; if you increase resistance for the same voltage, current decreases. Water analogy: voltage ~ pressure, current ~ water flow, resistance ~ pipe width/obstruction. Conservation: current is same at each point in a simple series loop (no leaks). We also distinguish conventional current direction (positive to negative) vs electron flow (negative to positive), but detail not crucial beyond noting opposite direction.
Suggested Experiment: Simple circuit build: Provide students with batteries, wires, and a small bulb. Have them light the bulb by connecting in a loop – identifying that a closed circuit is needed for current. Use a multimeter or ammeter if available to measure current, and a voltmeter to measure the battery voltage and voltage across the bulb. Demonstrate Ohm’s law: for example, use a variable resistor or different resistors – with the same  battery, measure how current changes (higher R, lower I). Or use two batteries (1.5 V and 3 V) with the same resistor or bulb – see the current or brightness roughly double at higher voltage. Show that disconnecting or “open circuit” stops current (like turning a switch off). If possible, show a resistor getting warm – indicating electrical energy converted to heat (Joule’s law). Emphasize safety with small batteries only.

Si ou ogmante rezistans nan yon sikwi, kisa ki rive kouran an si vòltaj la pa chanje? (If you increase the resistance in a circuit, what happens to the current if the voltage is unchanged?)"
Physics,NSIII,Chapit 8: Electric Circuits (Sikwi Éléktrik),Mèsi Sèn – Mezi ak Sekirite (Mesures Électriques & Sécurité),"Learning Objectives: Teach how to measure current and voltage in a circuit with ammeters and voltmeters properly (ammeter in series, voltmeter in parallel). Emphasize electrical safety: why short circuits are dangerous, the role of fuses/circuit breakers, and safe handling of electrical devices. Real-life examples of series and parallel: e.g., strings of holiday lights, a flashlight (series battery + bulb + switch), household wiring (parallel branches).
Key Concepts: To mezire kouran, an amet (ampè-mèt) is placed in series with the component so that the current flows through the meter. It has low internal resistance. To mezire vòltaj (tansyon), a vòltmèt is connected in parallel across the component (so it measures the difference in electric potential between the two points). It has high internal resistance (so it draws minimal current). Safety: short circuit (sòt-sikwi) means a path of very low resistance directly connects battery terminals – causing a massive current that can overheat wires or battery (danger of fire, battery explosion or rapid discharge). Fuses or circuit breakers break the circuit if current is too high, preventing overheating. Grounding (tè) is used in home wiring for safety: it provides a path to earth for stray currents. Never touch live wires; water and electricity is hazardous because the body and water conduct, causing shock. Always disconnect power before working on circuits. For DC battery circuits in class, the voltages are low (1.5V, 9V etc.), so safe, but mains electricity at 110V/220V can be lethal. Also mention proper use of multimeters (set correct mode and range). Real examples: a flashlight (lampoches) is a simple series circuit: cells in series, a bulb, and a switch. Christmas light strands can be in series (old style – one goes out, all out) or parallel (newer LED sets).
Suggested Demonstration: Show how to connect a multimeter as an ammeter vs a voltmeter in a simple circuit – perhaps project a diagram or actually wire it up with students. Deliberately create a “short” in a low-voltage circuit by connecting a wire across battery terminals bypassing a bulb – observe what happens: the bulb goes out (current bypasses it), the wire may get warm, and battery drains quickly. Use a small battery to avoid big hazards but it illustrates the point. Show a household fuse or breaker panel (photos or actual item) and explain its rating (e.g., 15 A fuse will blow if >15 A). Possibly show the grounding pin in a plug and discuss its function. Emphasize the rule: ammeter in series (if put in parallel by mistake, essentially short circuits through meter – bad for meter), voltmeter in parallel. Have them practice reading simple meter scales if analog, or interpret digital. Safety quiz or discussion: ask what to do if an appliance falls in water, etc., to gauge understanding.

Illustration: A simple series circuit with a battery, two bulbs, and a switch. Both bulbs carry the same current in series, and the diagram shows the single loop (yellow path) through battery (+ to –). In a parallel circuit, each bulb would form its own loop with the battery. This series circuit diagram helps visualize why bulbs dim as more are added in series (the single current must go through each resistor)."
Physics,NSIII,Chapit 8: Electric Circuits (Sikwi Éléktrik),Seri kont Paralèl – Ki Jan Nou Konbine Konpozan (Série vs Parallèle),"Learning Objectives: Compare series and parallel circuit configurations. Build understanding that in series: components are one after another (same current through each, voltage divides among them). In parallel: components share two nodes (same voltage across each, currents divide). Identify advantages of parallel wiring (e.g., in homes, if one device is off others still work, each gets full voltage).
Key Concepts: Sikwi an seri: Only one path for current. If multiple resistors/bulbs are in series, the same current $I$ flows through all. The total resistance increases (they add up), so for a given battery the current is less (bulbs dimmer if more added in series). Also, if one component fails (open circuit), current stops everywhere (like old Christmas lights in series – one out, all out). Sikwi an paralèl: Multiple branches – current splits between branches. Each branch sees the same voltage from the supply. The total resistance is lower (adding branches provides more paths). If one branch is broken or component off, others still carry current. In parallel, each device can operate independently at full voltage. That’s why home outlets are parallel – each appliance gets 120V (or local standard) and turning one off doesn’t cut power to others. We can calculate that two identical resistors in parallel give half the resistance of one, etc., but focus on concept. Also note: current adds up in parallel: $I_{total} = I_1 + I_2 + \dots$.
Suggested Experiment: Build series vs parallel circuits with bulbs: Using small light bulbs or LEDs, set up two bulbs in series with a battery – observe brightness. Then set up the same two bulbs in parallel across the same battery – note they are brighter (nearly as bright as a single bulb) because each gets full battery voltage. Use ammeters or measure current: in series, current through each is same; in parallel, measure current in each branch and the total from the battery (confirm total = sum of branch currents). Alternatively, measure the voltage across each bulb: in series, battery voltage splits (if equal bulbs, roughly half each); in parallel, each gets ~full battery voltage. A switch demo: put a switch in series – it controls entire series string; but a switch in one branch of parallel only affects that branch. Have students predict outcomes like adding a third bulb in series vs in parallel. These hands-on observations solidify the differences.

Physics,NSIII,Chapit 9: Electromagnetism (Élektwomayétis),Aplikasyon Elektwomayetis – Motè ak Transfòmateur (Applications: Moteurs & Transformateurs),"Learning Objectives: Summarize how electromagnetism is applied in everyday technology: electric motors (converting electricity to motion), loudspeakers, transformers for power distribution, and magnetic recording or maglev trains. While detailed workings can be complex, provide a conceptual overview to appreciate the impact of electromagnetism.
Key Concepts: Motè elektrik (electric motor): Essentially the reverse of a generator – if a current flows in a coil within a magnetic field, it experiences a force (Laplace force) that makes it rotate. A simple DC motor has a coil on an axle between magnet poles; when current passes, the coil becomes an electromagnet and is pushed to rotate. A commutator flips the current each half turn to keep it spinning. The result: electrical energy -> mechanical work (rotation). Motors are everywhere: fans, washing machines, electric cars, etc. Loudspeaker: A coil attached to a cone is in a magnetic field; when an audio current flows through the coil, it moves back and forth, vibrating the cone and producing sound. Transformer: Two coils and an iron core: AC in primary makes a changing field, inducing AC in secondary. If secondary has more turns, the voltage is higher (step-up); if fewer, lower voltage (step-down). Transformers enable efficient high-voltage transmission and then step-down for safe home use. Data storage (di magnétiques): Like credit cards or tape drives use magnetic fields to encode info on magnetic strips or disks (tiny domains oriented). Maglev trains: use electromagnetic coils that both levitate (magnetic repulsion) and propel the train without friction. MRI machines: use very strong magnetic fields and RF pulses to image the body (beyond scope, but mention electromagnets used). Emphasize how the interplay of electricity and magnetism has revolutionized technology.
Suggested Demonstration: If available, show a small DC motor kit or dissect a motor to point out coil and magnets. A simple motor demo: Make a homopolar motor with a battery, a screw, a wire, and a magnet (where the wire spins around the magnet on the battery). Or a simple coil motor: a coil of wire with enamel partially stripped, balanced on paperclip pivots, placed over a magnet – it will twitch/spin when connected to a battery. Show a speaker: if possible, carefully connect a small speaker to a function generator or just a battery tapped on/off – feel or see the cone move. Or use a large speaker with low-frequency audio to visibly vibrate. For transformer effect: show a phone charger (takes 120V AC to 5V DC) and explain inside is a transformer + rectifier. Maybe a demo with two coils around an iron core and a small light bulb on secondary (if resources and safe low voltage AC source). For fun, you could show a magnet falling slowly in a thick copper pipe (eddy currents creating magnetic damping) – illustrating induction and application (maglev braking).

Physics,NSIII,Chapit 9: Electromagnetism (Élektwomayétis),Elektrisite ak Mayetis – Eksperyans Ørsted (Électricité & Magnétisme),"Learning Objectives: Recount Ørsted’s famous experiment showing that an electric current generates a magnetic field (the birth of electromagnetism). Demonstrate that a compass needle is deflected by a current in a nearby wire. Introduce the right-hand rule conceptually for field direction around a straight wire. Build a simple electromagnet (a coil with current produces a magnetic field) and show it can attract iron.
Key Concepts: Electric currents produce magnetic fields. Ørsted’s experiment (Eksperyans Ørsted): when a compass is placed near a wire and current flows through the wire, the compass needle deflects, showing the wire created a magnetic field. The direction of this field encircles the wire (right-hand rule: thumb in current direction, fingers curl in direction of field). A selenoid (solenoid) or coil of wire concentrates this field; it acts like a bar magnet when current flows – this is an elektwomayet (électro-aimant). You can magnetize a piece of iron strongly by putting it inside a current-carrying coil (the iron’s domains align, strengthening the field). This electromagnetic magnet can be turned on/off with current, unlike a permanent magnet. Applications: cranes lifting scrap iron with electromagnets, electric bells, relays, and essentially all electric motors (which use electromagnets to create motion). The Lwa Laplace (Laplace’s law) describes force on a current in a magnetic field, which is the basis of electric motors (not detailed here, but worth mentioning that a current in a magnetic field experiences a force – moving coil in a motor). The stronger the current and more loops, the stronger the electromagnet.
Suggested Demonstration: Compass deflection: Straighten a long wire and connect it through a switch to a battery (or better, a DC power supply ~6V). Place a compass under the wire. When current flows, the needle swings perpendicular to the wire. Reverse current, the needle deflects opposite way (showing field direction flips). Ensure the wire is oriented N-S initially so Earth’s field aligns needle, then current’s field shows effect clearly. Electromagnet: Wrap insulated wire (e.g., 30 turns) around an iron nail; connect to a battery – use it to pick up paper clips or small iron objects. It will drop them when current off. Alternatively, demonstrate a pre-made electromagnet or the inside of a relay/buzzer. Show that without the iron core, the coil is weaker (pick up fewer clips), with core it’s much stronger – illustrating how ferrous core amplifies the magnetism (domains induced). If available, show a small DC motor disassembled to highlight the coils (electromagnets) and permanent magnets.

Physics,NSIII,Chapit 9: Electromagnetism (Élektwomayétis),Endiksyon Elektwomayetik – Lwa Faraday (Induction & Loi de Faraday),"Learning Objectives: Demonstrate electromagnetic induction: a changing magnetic field can induce an electric current in a conductor. Use Faraday’s law conceptually – moving a magnet through a coil or changing magnetic flux generates a voltage. Show a simple generator action (magnet + coil → current on galvanometer). Explain that this is how electricity is generated in power plants (coils and magnets). Also mention transformers (based on induction) and back-emf in motors.
Key Concepts: Faraday’s Law of Induction: A changing magnetic flux through a circuit induces an electromotive force (voltage) in the circuit. Practically, moving a magnet in/out of a coil induces a current (if circuit closed). The induced current direction follows Lenz’s Law (it opposes the change) – but for our level, just note that moving north pole in gives current one way, pulling out gives opposite current (and reversing magnet pole also reverses current). Faster change = larger induced voltage. No change (magnet held steady inside coil) = no current. Generator: If you rotate a coil in a magnetic field or vice versa, you continuously induce AC (alternating current). This is how generators work – mechanical energy turns coils in big magnets (or magnets in coils), producing electricity. Sonneri elektrik (doorbell) and microphones use induction: a changing current in coil causes magnet to move (speaker), or a moving coil in magnet produces current (mic). Transformer: Two coils; AC in primary coil creates changing magnetic field, which induces AC in secondary coil – allowing voltage to step up or down. Requires AC (since steady DC doesn’t induce after initial moment). We mention that high voltage transmission and many devices use transformers. Also mention Induction stove or wireless chargers – induction heating of metal via currents induced. This is an advanced concept, but showing that electromagnetic induction has huge applications gives context.
Suggested Demonstration: Magnet-coil induction: Connect a coil of several hundred turns (e.g. from a kit or make one) to a sensitive galvanometer or multimeter on AC or mV range. Thrust a bar magnet quickly into the coil – observe needle deflection. Pull it out – deflection opposite way. Move faster for bigger deflection. If you hold the magnet still inside – needle goes to zero (no induction). Alternatively, use two coils: connect one coil to a battery (make/break or AC), and second coil to meter – when current in first is switched on/off, second sees a pulse (transformer principle). Another easy demo: use a handheld generator (crank generator) or a DC motor used in reverse as generator – light an LED or small bulb by cranking. Or drop a strong magnet through a copper tube – it falls slowly due to eddy current induction (Lenz’s law braking – a striking visual if available). For transformer: if you have an AC power source and an iron core with two coils, show qualitative step-down or step-up (careful with mains though – perhaps skip actual demonstration in class for safety, but can show a phone charger as example of a small transformer + electronics).

Physics,NSIII,Chapit 9: Electromagnetism (Élektwomayétis),Mayet ak Chan Mayetik (Aimants et Champ Magnétique Terrestre),"Learning Objectives: Introduce magnets (mayet) and magnetic fields (chan mayetik). Describe the behavior of magnetic poles (north/south) and how opposite poles attract, like poles repel (similar to electric charges in that aspect). Explain that Earth itself is a giant magnet with a magnetic field, and a compass works by aligning to Earth’s field.
Key Concepts: A mayet (aimant) has two poles: north (N) and south (S). If a magnet is cut, each piece still has N and S poles. Opposite poles attract, same poles repel. Magnets attract certain metals (ferromagnetic materials: iron, nickel, cobalt) and can induce temporary magnetism in them. Chan mayetik (magnetic field) is the invisible field around a magnet in which magnetic forces act. We visualize it with lines from North to South pole outside the magnet. Earth’s magnetic field is like that of a bar magnet tilted relative to its rotation axis. A bousòl (compass) is a tiny magnet free to rotate – its North-seeking pole points toward Earth’s geographic north (which is actually a magnetic south pole in terms of physics). This helps navigation. Earth’s field also shields us from solar wind. We note that not all metals are magnetic (e.g., aluminum is not attracted). Also, magnets can lose magnetism if heated or dropped (domains randomize).
Suggested Experiment: Magnetic field line visualization: Place a bar magnet under a sheet of paper and sprinkle iron filings – they will align along field lines, revealing the pattern (be sure to collect filings carefully afterward). Use a compass around a magnet to show direction of field (compass arrow aligns along field lines). Show simple attraction/repulsion: take two bar magnets, feel the force as you bring like poles vs opposite poles near. Check various objects: nail (iron) gets attracted; a coin (depending on composition, e.g., US coins mostly not strongly magnetic), a piece of aluminum foil, plastic – see no attraction. Earth’s field demonstration: Hang a bar magnet by a string from its center or float it on a piece of cork in water – it will align roughly N-S (this essentially is a compass). Or simply use a compass to show Earth’s North direction in the classroom (compare to map). Possibly mention that the compass needle is aligning with Earth’s magnetic field lines.

Experiment/Demo: If available, use an oscilloscope (or simulator) to show a sinusoidal AC waveform. Demonstrate a simple resonance: e.g. an RLC circuit connected to a signal generator and an LED or small speaker – at resonance the LED glows brightest or the speaker gets loudest. If not physical, use a PhET AC circuit sim to sweep frequency and observe current peaking at resonance. Connect with analogy: just like pushing a swing at the right frequency, driving an RLC at its natural frequency maximizes current.
Quiz/Activity: Question: Why do radio receivers use LC circuits? (They resonate at the chosen station’s frequency to pick up that signal strongly). True/False: In AC circuits, a resistor’s opposition (resistance) changes with frequency (False, resistor is constant; inductive/capacitive reactance changes). Given a tuning circuit resonant at 1 MHz, what happens if you input 2 MHz? (It will not resonate strongly; current will be lower)."

The EdLight Labs cohort spent the summer prototyping micro-grid kits that can be assembled in a single afternoon. By pairing
hands-on engineering with community interviews, fellows designed a power system that supports classrooms, clinics, and small
businesses. The project blends solar capture, battery storage, and a lightweight monitoring app to maintain uptime during
storm seasons.

Our next phase brings the kits to three rural schools alongside a mentorship exchange with university researchers. If your
organization is interested in piloting the technology, reach out to our Labs team at labs@edlight.org.
